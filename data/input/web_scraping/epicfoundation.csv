"The Aangan Trust (Aangan) is a child protection organization promoting safe communities and  enabling children, adults and state governments in India to work together to prevent and respond to the  harm that children face. Aangan is centered around children who are normally hard to reach, such as  children in childcare institutions, working adolescents who are inadequately protected under labor laws,  out of school children isolated in their homes or at work in the informal sector, and children engaging in  illegal and risky activities. Aangan works on all of these issues through peer networks and advocacy.  Aangan focuses on so called ‘hotspots’, high-risk urban communities or rural villages where children are  vulnerable to trafficking, child marriage, hazardous work and abuse.; Aangan works to strengthen India’s child protection system so that even the most vulnerable child can have a safe childhood.; Shakti Girls Safety Networks: Girls living in slums and poor areas often face the risk of  being trafficked, exploited, abused or married-off  young. They are often confined to their home and  therefore cut off from school, peers and social  interaction. Shakti groups ensure that young girls have  the opportunity to be a part of a larger community.  Adolescent girls are empowered to recognize risks and  to develop strategies in order to resist pressures of child  marriage, dangerous work, and being pulled out of  school; to access services; to negotiate for themselves;  to articulate aspirations and to take steps towards  achieving their life goals. Shakti groups are facilitated  by Shakti activators, acting as coordinators and  residing in the community where the groups are  formed. Activators are trained to work with young girls  and to link girls facing imminent harm with Aangan  staff.  ; Chauraha Boys Safety Networks: Adolescent boys are often perceived as cheap  workers or troublemaker and their vulnerabilities go  largely unaddressed. Through Chauraha, adolescent  boys are connected to mentors and positive peer  groups. They are supported to challenge social  normative pressures around manhood; to recognize  the risks they face in their lives and exercise agency; to  articulate aspirations; to identify and strengthen  relationships with supportive adults; and to negotiate  for themselves. Boys learn to exercise citizenship and  develop a sense of self respect and responsibility by  working with local education officers and community  elders to enroll children in school, by advocating with  the ward officer to improve health and sanitation  facilities, and by mobilizing community support to  ensure the safety of children.  ; Parents & Children Against Trafficking/Harm (PACT): For a sustainable positive change, adults need to understand and commit to mitigating the long-term impact that  unsafe environments create for children. Through the PA sCT network, adult community volunteers are trained and  empowered to be aware of and alert to child protection issues such as early marriage, trafficking, violence and  abuse; to respond to the harm that children face; and to alert government systems and services to ensure  children’s safety and protection.
