Kelab Amal Wanita Langkawi,"View galleryIn 1991, a few Langkawi ladies got together and held their first Charity Dinner, the proceeds of which went to Sekolah Kebangsaan Kuah. Following its success, the ladies decided to form a social and registered charitable club?Kelab Puteri Langkawi (NGO). Today Kelab Amal Wanita Langkawi has a membership of around 30 ladies which includes many local business women and ladies from across the globe who are either just passing through or have decided to make Langkawi their long term home. 
The clubs? aim, as always, has been to provide charitable and social assistance for the benifit of all Langkawi residents and visitors - our main benificiary being the Langkawi General Hospital.
Korshida Begum has served two terms as Club President and is responsible for spurring her members on to come up with ideas for Charitable Events and forming the work committees to carry these ideas through. 
(Formerly known as Kelab Puteri Langkawi, in 2008 it was felt that our club name was being confused with other organisations. As this mix up could be detrimental to our fund raising efforts we therefore felt it would benefit us to have a complete name change, hence from June 2009 we will be known as KELAB AMAL WANITA LANGKAWI a Registered Non-Government Organization, and continue our aim to raise funds for the benefit of all Langkawians.)
