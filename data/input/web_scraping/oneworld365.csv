"         Hope Bright Future Center was established in the year 2002 in Soweto slum of Nairobi, Kenya to assist the needy children by offering free education and feeding programs to children aged 3 years to 15 years.     The Soweto slum, like many other slums in kenya and Africa, faces numerous difficulties such as poverty, strained health and education facilities and diseases related to poor nutrition such as kwashiokor and marasmus and HIV/AIDS. There are a few public schools in the slum which are inadequate for the large number of school going children in the slum. In addition, there are a few private schools, which are far beyond the reach of the slum dwellers most of whom live on less than a dollar a day. Thus the parents or guardians are unable to pay the school fees. Morever, the centre partners with Emanuel Children's Home to give orphans free education at the centre.           The need to provide these children with love, care and affection saw the birth of the Hope Bright Future Centre. The centre was started with a handful of children who could attend the school, they could be taught by one or two volunteer teachers and would be served with lunch courtesy of well wishers.            Through Hope Bright Future, children from the Soweto slum can have a bright and hopeful future! The children arrive at school with clean faces and big smiles going into classrooms where they encounter dedicated teachers and a beautiful facility courtesy of well wishers. As well, they are fed on nutritious lunches. When they leave the school at the end of the day, they are happy and confident.                       ",hope brighr future
