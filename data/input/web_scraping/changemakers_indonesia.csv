0,0,0,Zaini Alif,Indonesia,"As the popularity of digital games increases with children and education programs do not take play into account, children are missing out on opportunities to develop essential social skills. Zaini Alif identifies and reintroduces traditional toys and games as a way to ensure that the next generations build these skills.",Komunitas Hong,"Indonesia has already made a lot of investments into education, which led to significantly improved access to newly constructed primary schools. But, according to the 2010 national census, some 3.5 million children—mostly girls, the poor, and other disadvantaged children—remain out of school. Of those who do complete primary school, a large proportion fails to acquire the necessary level of skills. In the sub-urban poor village of Ciburial, Bandung, where Zaini has established the first Centre, for example, many primary school graduates or dropouts engage in illegal activities such as extracting payment from car or motorcycle parking attendants or torchlight rental from visitors in the nearby national park.
The urban poor focus more on meeting daily family needs than on ensuring the children go to school. In former times, children became creative, innovative, socially minded, and culturally rooted adults who were close to their environment through play. Now unfortunately, parents prefer children to be at home and do not allow them to play their traditional games outside or ensure the community provides playgrounds in the neighborhood. At home, children would rather spend most of their time watching television or, for those who can afford them, playing digital games. Many have blamed electronic games for stimulating children and young people to become violent and anti-social. Nonetheless, parents allow them to play these games rather than playing outside with other children. 
The education system does not encourage children to play and has not yet focused on raising learning outcomes, especially through play. In the past children learned a lot about science and nature through play. Even though neuroscience research asserts that children gain powerful knowledge, skills, values and attitudes through play, teachers are not using this untapped resource.","Zaini creatively engages communities to educate and socialize the next generation of leaders through traditional toys and games. He identifies and spreads traditional games as a way to increase children's empathy, creativity and connection to the environment. Zaini brings together children, parents, local community leaders, and young adults to ensure that children have access to play and get to know children from other villages, hires young people at the margins of society to become instructors, and involves the wider community in traditional forms of play. 
Zaini applies a three-pronged approach: highlighting the universal values of traditional games, enabling kids to play in the community center, and teaching the community to produce the games. His approach therefore values Indonesian traditional heritage while taking into account the need for economic sustainability in the community. In order to create wider impact, he works on influencing schools to incorporate traditional games into the school curriculum. As the outcome of his research, he has written books about traditional toys and games and, following his advocacy to local government, the books have been reproduced and distributed to public schools. The Provincial Education and Culture Office of West Java has recently launched the integration of traditional games as an introductory session for high school students, as it is already applied in primary schools. 
His Teacher Play Movement, where he transfers the values and the skills of playing traditional games to other teachers, has also been set up. He expects the teachers to develop their Hong (Cooperative) Community in their own area, which will add to the existing 6 communities already established in Java, Bali, and Sumatra. 
His work has also been introduced and presented to teachers in other countries. As further development and to back up the movement with data and information, Zaini is developing the Indonesian Toys Museum in partnership with the Bandung Institute of Technology.",https://www.changemakers.com/ashoka-fellows/entries/komunitas-hong,"Jl.

1,1,1,Nurokhim Nurokhim,Indonesia,"Thousands of street children are emerging in the rampant growth of cities in Indonesia. Nurokhim, once a street child himself, is meeting the needs of marginalized children for basic food, parenting, education, healthcare and economic opportunities and through that, building a road to full citizenship.",Sekolah Master,"An estimated 230,000 street children are spread across growing cities in Indonesia. Some may be living on the streets with their families or come from crowded homes in slums. Many parents of street children cannot afford to send their children to school. The situation worsened during Indonesia's economic crisis in 1998. To support the family, or for their own survival, many poor and marginalized children are forced to go out on the streets to work.
Street children are often victims of marginalized families who are not able to manage their households. Although the government has ratified the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC) and is committed to achieving the Education For All, street children are often excluded from basic government education programs, as they lack birth certificates and identity cards, and as such are not able to enroll in any formal schools. Furthermore, this conventional schooling system is not tailored to fit with street children's needs and conditions. 
Society has traditionally seen street children as a public nuisance. In the name of enforcing the Public Order Law, street children are detained by the Civil Service Police Unit. Their means of making a living – guitars for busking, goods for sale, for example – are confiscated. They are also subjected to verbal and physical abuse by other marginalized adults. Street children participating in what is said to be illegal behavior are sent to jail and treated as criminals by the police. In jail, their rights to education are abandoned. 
There have been many attempts to address the problem of street children. But these attempts are mostly delivery of one time donations or scholarships that are not sustainable. None have been able to address the systemic problem faced by street children and their marginalized families.","Based on his experience living in the street as a child, Rokhim has developed a holistic approach to meet street children's needs and enable them to develop into balanced adults by having a substitute family structure, access to education, life skills, and vocational training to enter the job market. By mobilizing the wider society– volunteers, alumni, students, parents, schools, lawyers and other partners - Rokhim is raising awareness about a problem that affects the entire nation and is reactivating disappearing traditional cooperative values in society. He is bringing full citizenship to street children who have been systemically discriminated against by society and is empowering dysfunctional street families with parenting, education, healthcare and micro enterprise support. 
Rokhim involves the children's families in the general welfare of street children, mixing fee-paying children with street children, and recruiting teachers with empathy for the children's experience of school. His school is open every day of the year. He is also extending his work to children in prison who are mainly underfed and negotiates with the government for remission for children who attend classes. He is measuring the effectiveness of his strategy. 
His main school, called Master School, is already a showcase for imitators. The West Java Province has adopted part of Rokhim's model as the Special Education Service for children with special needs who can now have access to life skills based education. It has also acknowledged that students from the School and related informal schools can participate in the national exams. The Master School approach has also become part of the rehabilitation program for prisons. In addition, Rokhim is advocating a national regulation to allow Isbat Marriage (marriage for couples already living together) for street children's parents. With this, street children will automatically have their birth certificates and identity cards issued, which is currently a major obstacle to getting into school. 
His successful model has moved volunteers to replicate it. There are now five independent Schools using his model in Bekasi, Bogor, Bandung, and East Jakarta. International civil society organizations such as World Education and Hope for our Children have also replicated the model. Other countries such as Thailand, Japan, and South Korea and the United Nations have visited the School to learn about it. To expand his impact, Rokhim plans to set up a Master University and Business School dedicated to street and marginalized children.",https://www.changemakers.com/ashoka-fellows/entries/sekolah-master,,+62 21 92612047,-6.390531,106.823833
2,2,2,Ellena Rachmawati,Indonesia,"Despite the high health, economic, and environmental costs of poor sanitation, public resources are limited for improved sanitation in Indonesia. Ellena Rachmawati mobilizes communities' own resources to establish self-reliant, healthy villages, addressing key issues such as sanitation, hygiene, and nutrition.",Yayasan Masyarakat Peduli,"Only 50% of Indonesians have access to clean water.  The natural springs for Lombok Island are in the Rinjani Mountain National Park that is threatened by deforestation and land conversion reduced water supply. The surface water flowing into the village in East Lombok is 71% contaminated by e-coli bacteria that causes diarrhea. Less than half of households use safe drinking water. 
In 2005, West Nusa Tenggara Province had an outbreak of diarrhea with over 30,000 cases, which was due to lack of clean water supply. This was made worse by the long dry season that causes respiratory infections in children. Dozens of children died every day. People still defecate in rivers or in the field, as there are no toilets or sewage system. They continue to wash hands without soap and using dirty water.
Although the national government has allocated IDR 10 trillion for a nation-wide sanitation program, East Lombok only receives IDR 170 million to cover 256 villages with 1.1 million people. Despite the limited budget on sanitation, villages keep waiting for government projects or foreign donors to solve their problems. While some villages have tried to address these with their own resources, many have failed, as they were not well organized.
Rural people do spend significant amounts on certain things such as cigarettes or family visits. For example, in Lombok, people have a very close kinship system. Whenever they hear that a family member is ill, they make all possible efforts to visit. This also implies costs for the hosting family to accommodate visitors. Ellena estimates this spending to be as high as IDR 100 million per extended family yearly.","Ellena instigates a behavioral and cultural change in rural communities by activating them to leverage their own resources for health and environmental development instead of depending on external projects. She overcomes passivity within villages by raising the important issues of health, sanitation, and clean water, and guides the villagers to make their own decisions.
Her work includes teaching the community to change its daily habits. Although this is important in itself for improved sanitation and health, it is also the first step towards wider self-reliance and an important stage in establishing a realistic bridge between the community and outside resources. She goes beyond mapping the needs and resources to engage the communities in what they themselves want to change.
In bringing to light the way in which villages can choose to spend their money – for example, to implement programs to prevent sanitation-related illnesses instead of spending those resources to visit those who have fallen ill after the fact – Ellena opens up a new option for the villages' financial resources and empowers them to proactively solve their own problems. While local community members generally take a minimal role in managing their own health when a program is directed by the government or a foreign donor, Ellena overcomes this challenge of community passivity by mobilizing communities to creatively use their own resources. Ellena is thus not only changing the perception of the value of local resources, but is also changing the habits and behaviors of community members toward sanitation, hygiene and nutrition solutions. 
In practice, prior to establishing an independent healthy village, Ellena and her team make clear to the villagers that they do not bring any funding for sanitation projects. Ellena raises awareness about the causes of sanitation-related diseases and the ecological damage that reduces water discharge. While raising the fact that the government has a very limited budget for sanitation programs while the problem continues, she makes the point that there are no poor villagers as long as they have the money to spend elsewhere. 
Once she receives an invitation from the community, she starts with clean water provision – through building water pipes from freshwater sources and community management of reservoirs – as an entry point into the whole interconnected chain of water, sanitation, health, and environmental protection. Once access to clean water is established within a village, the community is able to save money on water management as well as generate revenue by providing it to surrounding villages. This combined with the cost savings of illness-related travel and other expenses, serve as bedrock for community investment. 
Ellena has already begun to replicate her model in 47 villages and to train other organizations to bring her model in Papua and Sulawesi.",http://www.ympntb.org,,,,
3,3,3,bagus utomo,Indonesia,"Despite the plethora of challenges surrounding mental health in Indonesia, healthcare still fails to prioritize the issue.Ssocial stigma has therefore extremely harmful effects on those living with mental illness. Bagus Utomo is organizing a nation wide mental health consumer groups to break the chains of stigma and improve the healthcare and the lives of people living with schizophrenia in Indonesia.",Yayasan Peduli Skizofrenia Indonesia,"The number of reported psychiatric cases in Indonesia recently experienced a sharp increase. It is estimated that more than one million Indonesians suffer from schizophrenia. Indonesian official data stated that only around 36,000 patients have received medication and the rest is untreated. Although it's not a deadly illness, 30 percent of schizophrenic patients become very depressed and suicidal. Global studies estimate that more than one million people living with schizophrenia in the ages between 15-34 commit suicide each year. 
Citizens suffering from mental health disorders face a double-edged sword. Not only do they have to contend with serious, disruptive symptoms, they still have to deal with rampant stigma and are subjected to discrimination and social exclusion. For example, due to the shame and the fear of the treatment, many families do not seek treatment, which have worsened the patients' condition. Despite the fact that it is manageable and could be cured, families otherwise perceive mental disorders as unpreventable and incurable and some even associate with black magic. There is no information available in Indonesian about schizophrenia and other mental health illness. Due to the minimum knowledge and awareness on how to treat, families physically restrain schizophrenic patients using chains, ropes, cages, or other confined spaces. Some others would even leave the patients untended and wonder around out in the street. 
Mentally disorder patients furthermore face self-stigma –stigma that comes from within, which becomes the major barriers for patient's recovery. The patients internalize mental illness stigma and experience diminished self-esteem and self-efficacy as they less likely to seek treatment. Psychiatric practice has nonetheless centered on pharmaceutical treatments, rather than counseling and therapy. In addition to not providing the patients and the families with necessary information, psychiatrists have limited skills to offer an effective treatment. With only 700 psychiatrists working in Indonesia, their practice misses to engage patients, families and the community as part of the healing process.","Moved by years of struggle for getting his brother a recovery, Bagus is developing Indonesia's first mental health consumer group called KPSI (Indonesia Community Care for Schizophrenia) since 2007. Through the group, not only that people with schizophrenia are now able to break their own self-stigma, the family could work to take care of their family members and together they get over the burden of public stigma. Through this consumer group, patients, caregivers (colleagues and family), doctors (physiologists and psychiatrist), sufferers, and survivors (sufferers who already passed the culmination stage) share experience, knowledge, and learning. The care provided by the consumer group members become part of the community based psychosocial therapy, which the current health care failed to provide.
The absence of information and awareness of schizophrenia and other mental health disorders created stigma against people with mental disorders and their families. Bagus has therefore set up an online information centre, which has been evolving from web based, online to offline facebook group, to drop in centre and peer support group. He started with hundreds to 8,800 community members now connected online and offline of facebook groups spread in 10 cities. From the pilot in Jakarta, he is now setting up KPSI Jogyakarta and planning to grow the facebook groups become KSPI in different provinces in Indonesia. 
To link to the current Government health care, Bagus is developing KSPI (http://peduliskizofrenia.org/) as a Community Mental Health Centre playing as part of the referral system to the current Public Health Centre (Puskesmas) in every sub-district. Currently, KSPI provides peer support of the survivors for those who are still working on the medication as well as psychosocial therapy not only for schizophrenic but also bipolar/manic depression and other mental illness. To ensure the mental health service is widely spread, Bagus is participating in the policy advocacy work for the new Mental Health Act, by which he hopes that the upcoming National Health Insurance will provide options to the current severe side effect generic drugs.",https://www.changemakers.com/ashoka-fellows/entries/yayasan-peduli-skizofrenia-indonesia,,,,
4,4,4,Purnawan Budisetia,Indonesia,"Despite the growing number of disability in Indonesia, prevention measures have not been taken into consideration. Purnawan Budisetia is working on preventing disability caused by certain congenital birth defects resulting from intermarriage. He does this by working within the traditional culture of Balinese religion.",Yayasan Peduli Kemanusiaan,"A recent report estimates that globally eight million children each year are born with serious disorders caused at least partly by their genes.  That is about six percent of all births worldwide. The study links high birth-defect rates in developing countries to poor health care and nutrition.  The researchers also note higher than average rates of marriage among blood relatives.
Many disabled people are hindered by the deep-seated social and cultural norms. In some traditional communities intermarriage, which could possibly result in disabled offspring due to genetic disorder, remains in practice. In Bali, for example, although forbidden in modern Balinese religion, marriages between siblings or cousins are still desirable to keep property and assets in the family. With the current practice, DNA testing to prevent birth defects is unfortunately unpopular. 
Despite the growing population of disabilities, local culture and tradition have marginalized disabled people. For example, over generations, Balinese view people with physical disabilities as being cursed. Disabled people are therefore not allowed to pray in temples and engage in religious practices. Perceived as a family disgrace, parents sometimes ostracize their disabled children, leaving them isolated in the home and not treated the same way as other children. Almost half of poor disabled children never go to school due to the shame to their families, as well as being rejected by the public schools. Likewise, many disabled elderly are kept inside untreated. Most disabled people then resign themselves to their fate of being the invisible and unwanted people.","Purnawan is working on changing the cultural value system as part of preventive measures against disability. Since it is difficult to break through the culture of cast system especially to get the buy in of the highest caste priest of Brahmana, Purnawan has successfully engaged religious leaders (Pandita) from the lowest cast priests to bring about the idea. Together with parents of disabled children, these Pandita educate people about the high risks of intermarriage and disability. While preaching, they remind people to discontinue and avoid forbidden marriages, including intermarriage as written in the Balinese Hindu traditional customs. Purnawan also works with religious communities to break the stigma against disability, which is perceived to be a punishment for misdeeds in the past thus is not allowed to go to temples for praying. Now disabled people could practice their religion and pray in temples. Purnawan also works with schools and council young people on intermarriage as part of adolescence reproductive health education. 
Purnawan integrates rehabilitation and education for the disabled people to improve their lives as equal citizens. Having reversed the traditional belief about disability as a family disgrace, Purnawan has been able to convince parents not only to let their children go outside, access the rehabilitation therapy and get education, but also to take part in the rehabilitation therapy at home. He has linked this program with the District and Provincial Social Welfare Bureaus through their Social Service Mobile Unit.

5,5,5,ewa Wojkowska,Indonesia,"Millions of people living in remote areas do not have access to electricity and clean water. On the other hand, simple, technology based solutions exist but are not reaching the people in far-flung communities. Ewa Wojkowska has created distribution systems in order for people in remote areas to have access to life-changing technology in Indonesia and other parts of the world.",Kopernik,"An estimated  81.6 million Indonesians still do not have access to electricity. About 40 percent of Indonesia's households—around 24.5 million households, located mainly in rural areas—still rely on traditional biomass energy (mainly fuel wood) as their primary cooking fuel, which emit vast quantities of polluting smoke. There are only 30 percent of city residents who have access to clean water and the number drops to only 10 percent in villages. Great technologies, which are designed for the poor to solve the above mentioned problems are numerous. They can improve people's lives, nonetheless, their dissemination and adoption are limited esepecially in remote areas. Technologies like solar lights, fuel-efficient cook stoves, agricultural and health tools, water filters are amongst technologies that could change millions of people's lives, however they are not yet reaching those in greatest needs. 

Remote communities are unreachable by road or isolated by heavy rains for months. These are places where there are no couriers, no postal system, no shipping agents and no technology stores. The more remote the community are, the more technology producers are challenged by the high cost for transportation. Due to the expensive product people unfortunately cannot afford the technologies. Furthermore, due to no access to technology information, remote communities have no demand despite they are the most in needs. 
Unfortunately there is no support mechanism provided by the government.   While some of the technologies are distributed by other organizations, they are generally sold via existing distribution channels including urban or peri-urban stores but not available outside of large capital cities. Moreover, when these products are available in the last mile market, in addition to being unaffordable, there is no mechanism to back up the consumers for its efficacy and impacts. There are some existing NGO or government programs in Indonesia that distribute technologies at no cost to certain communities, these nonetheless are very limited in scope and are not sustained over the long term.","Ewa has created a system that connects existing but currently disconnected actors to ensure that far-flung communities have access to appropriate technologies to improve their welfare. Together with Kopernik, an organization she and her husband co-founded, Ewa is creating distribution channels that engage local civil society organizations, cooperatives, savings and loans groups, local kiosks, funders or investors, and technology producers to ensure that last-mile communities have access to much needed appropriate technologies to address their basic needs. These technologies include water filters, solar lights and fuel efficient cookstoves. 

Creating a system to make the technologies accessible is important, as is making sure that the technologies are affordable. Ewa, moving away from a solely philanthropic approach is balancing business and philanthropy by using donations from corporations and individual donors to pay for the up-front cost of purchasing and shipping technology and then providing technology on a consignment basis to local partners. Then the local partners ensure that people have access to credit or installment payment schemes to further make the technologies affordable. 
Unlike other technologies that reach the market without verifying impact, Ewa has developed a feedback mechanism engaging the users and producers and technical university support, to ensure the products work as intended and the people in the last mile are well served.  The system provides the ability to find out whether anything has gone wrong - so that this can be addressed - and identify aspects of the technology that need to be improved by the technology producers. With the mechanism, Ewa ensures the technologies brings positive impact to the people, the technologies perform effectively (and if not, that the problems are addressed or the technology is no longer distributed) and the producers are able to best serve their clients.  

With the system in place, at least 25,000 life-changing technologies have been serving more than 140,000 people in 14 countries of whom 60,000 are from Indonesia spread across 10 provinces. The system has engaged at least 53 local civil society organizations, 38 technology producers, 24 funding partners and 23 in-kind partners. As it has shown positive impact, aspects of the model are being adopted by programs in big multinational corporations, the World Bank and the UN Agencies.",http://kopernik.info/,,,,
6,6,6,sumadi sakinem,Indonesia,"In the belief that the government's efforts alone are not sufficient to fix Indonesia's acute sanitation problems, Sumadi, a sanitarian, is cultivating sanitation entrepreneurs to help rural Indonesia have better access to proper sanitation and reduce water pollution, while creating job opportunities at the same time.",Karya Sanitasi,"The Problem 
From a population of 250 million, 70 million Indonesians still live without access to basic sanitation facilities. Open defecation or direct river defecation is still common practice among 19% of the urban population and 40% of the rural population. National data claims that around three quarters of households are discharging raw sewage into paddy fields, ponds, lakes, rivers, and the sea; only one quarter are connected to septic tanks or improved pits. In addition to the environmental damages, which include water pollution and a reduction in the productivity of the land, the problem has caused serious outbreaks of preventable diseases such as diarrhea and cholera, resulting in major losses to the country. 
District governments fund sanitarians, a functional position at Community Health Centers (Puskesmas). Their main responsibility is illness prevention through environmental health and hygiene initiatives in the dedicated villages within sub-district areas. One sanitarian is usually responsible for covering eleven villages or serving a population of 10,000-20,000. Not only is this number below the number of people and communities that need to be served,, but sanitarians are also not keeping pace with changes in health conditions in Indonesia and fail to make the appropriate adjustments. With a supply provision mindset, sanitarians are not able to see local potential, mobilize communities and other professionals to collaborate in order to address the problem. New Health School graduates wish to become civil servants and public service providers, which is what the school prepares the students to become, rather than skilled workers ready to tackle their communities' problems with innovative solutions.
In addition to the human resource challenges, the government has not put sanitation as a high priority on their agenda. Although aiming for communities to be 100 percent open defecation-free has already been set as one of the government's five-year goals, the government's limited support on provisions for sanitation construction has failed to stimulate the community to voluntarily build their own facilities. Even those receiving the stimulant packages have often failed to build the toilets by themselves due to lack of information and skills and the government's lack of investment in supporting healthy behaviors. Worse, by and large, international and local NGOs and donors have followed suit with these supply driven models, which undermine people's willingness to pay for the facilities. To a large extent, sanitation programs are still driven and financed as a part of donor-funded water and sanitation loan programs and national level budgets in Indonesia. Not only has the approach created dependency on the government's subsidies, it leaves the facilities unmaintained and therefore unsustainable due to a poor sense of ownership. Not surprisingly, even when these public toilets are available, many still continue to practice unhealthy behaviors.","By redefining the role of sanitarians, Sumadi has shifted the attitude and behavior of sanitarians from a passive employee mindset to one of a community entrepreneur. Together with his 38 sanitarian community entrepreneurs, who also play the role of marketers, Sumadi has been able to engage village midwives, construction workers, building material suppliers, and community members to bring about 5,000 units of household toilets serving over 25,000 poor people in the Nganjuk District, East Java, among other cities in Indonesia. 
Sumadi envisions each sanitarian as a community entrepreneur, a professional who can perform above their duties and act beyond only implementing a sanitation campaign. By using a market-based approach, Sumadi's sanitarians have reduced inefficiencies in the supply chain. Like doctor-pharmacist-drugstore partnerships, Sumadi helps sanitarians build relationships with construction workers and building material suppliers. Through the Indonesia Association of Sanitation Management and Empowerment (APPSANI), he connects the Sanitation Works Association (Asosiasi Karya Sanitasi) with construction workers, material suppliers, and the Association of Sanitation Entrepreneurs (Asosiasi Pengusaha Sanitasi) to join efforts in facilitating the emergence of sanitation demands across different villages in Indonesia. 
His model has been replicated across at least 38 districts and associations have been set up in nine cities in Java, Lombok, Sulawesi and Papua islands. His model has also inspired the village youth in South Kalimantan to become community sanitation entrepreneurs. Now Sumadi is approaching Schools of Health Polytechnic in Aceh and Surabaya to include entrepreneurship curriculum in order to build a community of future sanitarians.",https://www.changemakers.com/ashoka-fellows/entries/karya-sanitasi,,,,
7,7,7,Kinari eve Webb,Indonesia,"When Indonesia's natural resources have been degraded in an alarming speed, leaving the destructive environment impacting on human health, Kinari Webb,a medical doctor, is creating a system that improves healthcare, healthier environment, and better livelihood for communities living by the Indonesia's National Parks.",Health in Harmony,"Indonesia is the owner of the third largest area of tropical forest in the world that serves as a lung to the earth. Nonetheless, the forest is unfortunately disappearing at an alarming rate due to illegal logging done by companies and people living around it. By 2007, the forest in Indonesia has lost about 70 percent of its area. Illegal logging in Gunung Palung National Park, West Kalimantan, for example, is threatening its inhabitants including the endangered species such as hornbills, gibbons and orangutans. Mostly moved by an economic drive, the illegal logging practice has done over generations where people are not aware of the practice jeopardizing the environment and their livelihood.
The lifestyle of the people living by the forest also creates health problems in the area. People do not eat vegetables because they do not grow them. Five years ago the vegetables were imported from Java, therefore expensive. This unhealthy lifestyle led to many health problems such as malnutrition and diarrhea. In Indonesia, which has 16 physicians per 100,000 people, 12 times lower than the ratio in the United States, medical care is a scarce commodity. In rural areas, the ratio is even worse: in West Kalimantan there are three clinics where 60,000 residents share one doctor. For people living in remote areas, they have to travel quite a long distance to get high quality health service, which is not cheap. They turn to illegal logging to get some fast cash without knowing that it would destruct the forest which leads to the spread of communicable diseases caused by the destructive environment, for example respiration illnesses, tuberculosis, dengue fever and malaria. 
Many organizations apply a silo approach with a focus on either forest conservation or healthcare with less interest in addressing people's related problem. There are civil society organizations providing high quality of healthcare in rural areas, however, they focus exclusively on human health. Similarly, other organizations offer economic incentive for conservation, which exclusively focusing on environmental goals. The government service is very much sector oriented in addition to their lack of people's or client based services. There is not yet that help people address the challenges in a holistic environment while creating healthcare system also improving a healthier environment –physical and economically.","Kinari Webb is developing an intertwined approach to improving people's health and their environment. Through this new mechanism, people living by the buffer zone of the Gunung Palung National Park, could access the affordable high-quality health care as well as become forest defenders who protect the rain forests. Through her organization Health in Harmony, she has introduced the ASRI (Alam Sehat Lestari / Healthy Nature Everlasting) program, which is combining health care, conservation, environmental education and medical training in Sukadana. For the health care system she created an alternative payment mechanism where people are able to pay by non-cash methods through labor in the clinic or the rainforest. They can also help with the reforestation, pay with seedlings or organic fertilizers or paying with local crafts. The organic farming program Kinari introduced has turned farmers from loggers into guardians of the forest.
Kinari also set up an incentive mechanism both to make people healthy and to restrain people from illegal logging. The incentive is set for people living in villages with less illegal logging cases would get 70% discounted health service fee. To make the mechanism works, a forest patrol system is set where villagers are trained and recruited as forest guardians. Not only doing the monitoring, they also talk to villagers about illegal logging and its implications. This method has managed to lower illegal logging in the area as much as 68% whilst keeping the people healthy. Kinari realizes that approaching just the adults is not enough. She then engages children in learning about forest protection and recycling while introducing hygiene practices. 
Kinari is already preparing to replicate her model in Raja Ampat National Park in Papua this year. She has partnerships with top universities in the US where they send their doctors to learn about tropical diseases. These doctors share knowledge with the local doctors in the clinic, making the clinic a training centre. She is also planning to partner with local universities to spread her impact even more. Just recently, Kinari has been approached by an International Environmental Taskforce for United Nation REDD+ (Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation) who partners with the government. They are interested in replicating her model to other areas of Indonesia.",http://www.healthinharmony.org/,,,,

Rather they are heavily reliant on testing and assessment, run standalone subjects such as arts, rely on memorizing texts, which eventually dampens student's creativity. There are multimedia vocational schools newly set up by the government to nurture creative talents, however, there is no proper resources and training for teachers. To learn animation, for example, people needs to go to university or study abroad – and both options are expensive. There are no multiple pathways for skill development for youth. 
The government has committed to the development of creative economy and issued the President Instruction No. 6 Year 2009 which is followed by setting up a new Ministry of Tourism and Creative Economy in 2011. The government officials of this new Ministry, nonetheless, does not have the knowledge about creative economy and how to develop the industry which resulted to production of unclear policy direction. Animation as a branch of creative industry is hardly developed in Indonesia despite the huge market. The products are highly imported with no local content. For those, who already started to produce have no outlets to display their work, or any TV shows or regular festivals to link them with the audience.","In preparing a new generation of innovators, Wahyu builds an alternative ecosystem for young people to nurture and develop their creativity skills. Through the development of non-formal school for animation and creativity  – the first of its kind in Indonesia, Wahyu is fostering creative skills and cultivating young talents feeding the newly emerging creative industry. Applying a simple yet effective creativity and animation curriculum, anyone can gain skills in a short period of time with an affordable price. For further outreach Wahyu strengthens government formal vocational schools with curriculum on multimedia and equips Islamic Boarding schools with creativity learning and introduction to new skills on animation. At least 2,500 young people and thousands more from the formal schools have gained the skills. And some these young talents have taken their career path in developing their own small businesses in the creative industry.
To boost the growing numbers of young talents with their innovative products, Wahyu set up a creative platform as a hub for creative talents, general public and the industry to meet and engage. Through this new platform, young talents have both gained support from and inspired the wider society and the creative industry. This mechanism has thus leveraged the economic benefits for all players. The online and offline platforms he developed have become a productive outlet to reach out a wider audience and spur the creativity learning. He also developed a virtual homebase as part of building a social movement around creative design. The platform grew into a massive campaign on nationalism through designs for t-shirts and other products. There are 10,000 digital creators actively participate in the creative design movement including strong 50,000 Facebook & Twitter followers engaging in the spread of the movement vision. 
Wahyu works closely with the government to develop and support creative talents across the country. In addition to the creative education, he also works with the newly set up Ministry of Tourism and Creative Economy helping the staff understand about the creative economy.  Through the partnership he's able to send out best creative talents to foreign festivals with supports from the government. To give wider impact internationally, he is now setting up some cooperation agenda with other governments from England and Japan.",http://hellomotion.com/,,,,
9,9,9,Masnuah Masnuah,Indonesia,"The fishery sector has been under developed since Indonesia's independence in 1945. Despite Indonesia's unique geography as an archipelago with vast marine and coastal resources, 16 million people or almost fifty percent of the fishing community population are impoverished. Fisherwomen bring in half of their family income yet are faced with social, economic, and cultural boundaries by the fishing community and the general public. Masnu'ah, a fisherwoman herself, has developed means to break through the isolation of women in the fishing community and has led the path for fisherwomen to be treated as equal citizens.",Puspita Bahari,"Indonesia is a maritime country where 37 million fisherfolk live along the 80.000 km of archipelago coastline. However, 44% (16 million) of them still live in poverty. Most of the fishermen earn from subsistent fishing or being ship laborers. Fisherwomen, who contribute 48% to the fishing industry by doing fish processing and fish trading, are nonetheless still isolated and invisible from the laws and norms of the society as equal citizens. Statistics from the 2010 Indonesia National Commission on Violence against Women further indicated that 96% of the 105,103 cases reported were domestic violence against women. In a coastal district of Jepara, 30% of 278 HIV/AIDS cases reported by 2012 are housewives. In these traditional and marginalized communities, women are treated as secondary citizens and prohibited by the family to have further education and participate in public sphere let alone engage in decision making for the family and society. Most women in the fishing community have only graduated from primary school. The absence of support for the fisherwomen in these conservative communities has perpetuated marginalization against women.
Despite its marine resources, Indonesia's fishery development has just been evolved in the past decade, and recently marked by the establishment of Ministry of Marine Affairs and Fisheries in 2009. Since Indonesia's independence, the focus of development was put heavily on agriculture while fishery was a small government's initiative under the Agriculture Ministry. Development programs were developed to support farmers and their farming activities. This has made the fishing communities left behind from the development. With the climate change that resulted to the decrease in fish catch and limits access to sailing, lives of fishing community get harder than they already have. Many fishermen ended up in a lot of debts to loan sharks, who provide loans with excessive interest rate and are paid by the fishermen' fish catch in way below market price. Average monthly income for fisherman are around 500 thousand rupiahs ($50) while their debt could be about 1-2 million rupiahs ($100-200). With the new Ministry, the Government provided development support and subsidy programs for fishermen. However, the policy and regulations are gender bias since the programs are dedicated only for men. By Law fisherwomen is not yet included as a profession. For example, the Ministry recently endorsed the Fisherfolk Card -a subsidy program, which was created to assist fishermen with fuel, education and health costs. These programs only referred to the men who sail to fish, once again leaving women out of the conversation and ignored in occupational terms.
The fishing communities are very much structured and ruled by men. Women are marginalized by the traditional patriarchy society, despite the fact that their role encompasses almost 50% of family income. Seen as less important than the fishermen themselves, women are isolated from access to public goods such as education and health services, access to wider economic opportunities outside their homes, and the freedom of expression or unifying and empowering organizations. Domestic violence is a prominent issue facing Indonesian women today and in particular those in fishing communities partly due to misinterpretations of the Qur'an regarding marital relationships. With no available resources, women keep silent about the violence they face, which is perceived as the norm by the community as a whole and cultural stigma to hide evidence of abuse. There is no peer or social support when women face domestic violation. Legal remedies for women are still out of reach. 
Surprisingly, neither civil society nor government has concentrated on fisherwomen. Women's rights movements have tended to focus on women in cities or on farms rather than fisherfolk. Some civil society organizations have started to empower fisherwomen's economy to develop their fish catch processing businesses through vocational skill training. The projects have been unsustainable as they are very much relied on external supports. These few existing women-oriented programs solve some of the situations, mainly the economy. However, by lacking gender focus, the projects perpetuate inequality and create new problems, such as family problems and children's neglect.  The national fisherwomen network has just started to emerge, however most are preserving the subornation role of women and not changing the positions of women as equal citizen as men.","Masnu'ah works to challenge the patriarchal culture of the fishing community in a positive and inclusive way through her cooperative Puspita Bahari. By involving both women and men in her approach, she is has been able to find a socially acceptable method to move toward gender equity. Masnu'ah has not only improved the existing condition of women and shifted the position of fisherwomen as equal citizens; she has also changed the national regulation recognizing fisherwomen as an official occupation, who are now thus entitled to the government subsidy programs. 
After decades of limited support, government agencies and civil society have started to improve the economy of fishermen. Masnu'ah has played an active role in this transition by addressing the strategic role fisherwomen play for the family as well as the wider society. By inclusively engaging family members, religious leaders, government officials, civil society organizations and the wider society, Masnu'ah has broken the system of isolation fisherwomen face to enable them to enjoy rights and benefits as equal citizen.  In Demak District (1.2 million people), Central Java, for example, fisherwomen are now able to manage access to the whole value chain of fishing business including working capital, fishing boats as productive tools, pre and post fish processing businesses. 
Masnu'ah has further advanced the position of fisherwomen by actively engaging their husbands. By renting fishing boats to the fisherwomen's husbands, the fisherwomen gained an equal position in the society. Not only did Masnu'ah help detach husbands from loan sharks, she also multiplied their income. This has furthermore motivated the husbands to establish the Association of Fisherwomen's Husbands to work on improving their economic activities under the leadership of the Fisherwomen Coop Puspita Bahari. Prior to having access to rent fishing boats, husbands have to agree to learn more about gender equality and the issues facing women in the area. Through this, Masnu'ah is able to gain community acceptance and begin to change men's attitudes towards women. 
In addition to addressing inequalities in the fishing industry, Masnu'ah's model also strives to address other concerns about gender equality that impact fisherwomen. Masnu'ah has been able to use her cooperative to mobilize fisherwomen to broaden their knowledge and network and set up peer support system. Through this system, fisherwomen are fulfilling their rights to be free from HIV/AIDS infection and domestic violations as reports stated that both cases are increasing in fishing communities. For future generation of fisherfolk, Masnu'ah has worked with the government officials and the community to ensure that their children get access to education. These issues had previously been invisible in society, but Masnu'ah is working to draw attention to them and engage the community to address them.
With the vision to spread the impact to other fishing communities, Masnu'ah is currently working on replicating her model through her co-founded national network of Indonesian Fisherwomen Sisterhood, which she leads the Java region among other two Sumatra and Sulawesi regions. With the success in changing the regional regulation, networked with the national NGO for Fisherman Life, KIARA, Masnu'ah has changed the policy of Ministry of Marine Affairs and Fisheries to acknowledge fisherwomen as an occupation and thus entitle to access the government's subsidy through Fisherfolk Card program.",https://www.changemakers.com/ashoka-fellows/entries/puspita-bahari,,,,
10,10,10,Handojo Tjandrakusuma,Indonesia,"World Health Organization estimated 7-10% of Indonesia's population lives with diffabilities, and around 2% still needs rehabilitation services. HandojoTjandrakusuma, a medical doctor, has created systems that engage multi stakeholders at different levels to ensure diffable in Indonesia and the world to have a quality of life.",Rena,"World Health Organization estimated 7-10% of Indonesia's population lives with diffabilities, and around 2% still needs rehabilitation services. However, there is only 0.01% to 0.02% of the population actually get such services. The rest is hindered by distance, poverty and government's policy that is not in favor of the rural poor despite Indonesia's 80% population living in rural villages. The Departments of Health, Social Affairs and Education had existing programmes that assisted diffable people in various ways. In addition to these government programmes, there were nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), which supplemented these services. They were responsible for running special schools and training centers for the blind, deaf and mentally challenged, rehabilitation centers specializing in orthopedic conditions, etc. However, most of the rehabilitation services are located mainly in cities. Poverty has prevented people in rural areas to travel to big cities. Transportation is expensive and doctors are unwilling to practice in relatively isolated places. 
Rehabilitation services viewed as a medical, educational, vocational and social service delivered directly to individuals with diffabilities. Nonetheless, the service treats the diffable as passive service recipient despite theirneeds toengage in thephysical and social environment in their community.This individualapproach does not address the holistic problem ofdiffabilitywhilecommunity's attitude, beliefs, and behaviors towards diffability still become the barriers to the problem. The services are waiting for clients to come to them instead of them reaching out to clients. While the serviceis a sequence of both preventive and curative treatment measures, rural people do not understand how to do the preventive measures themselves nor know that the rehabilitation services even existor what kind of help needed. This kind of service does not allow the community to participate in the rehabilitation process.
Coverage of services for disability prevention and rehabilitation needed to be expanded, as diffables are everywhere. However, an increase in only the government and nongovernment services would be ineffective as with the current approach the community's involvement would be minimal. Furthermore, as the programs for the diffable have now improved in a lot of ways addressing problems of diffability in perspective of medical, education and vocational. However, engagement of diffable in the tourism industry is still far from meeting rights to live in a quality of life. The infrastructure to access the services provided by the industry is still not diffable friendly.  For example not all hotels and airports have ramps or toilets for the diffable. This problem does not only touch the diffable tourists, but also the diffable actors in the tourism industry. Despite their potentials contributing to the workforce for the industry, there is little employment created for the diffable such as whether that being a tourist guide or craftmakers that supply crafts for the tourist. Alas, there is no curriculum on barrier free tourism available at the schools of tourism. Although it has been introduced in many countries, but the barrier free tourism has only been done partially and not is seen as a whole. There is still a lot of work that needs to be done in Indonesia to make the country friendly for diffable tourists.","Despite most diffable children living in Indonesia's rural areas, the assistance was not available. Handojo has introduced a system for community-based rehabilitation where families and other community members actively participate in the early detection and funds mobilization for necessary treatment in the promotion of integrating diffable in all spheres of life and activities. He integrates the new system into the existing service delivery system so that it could do better outreach to all in need, especially those living in rural areas. With the system he has been able to make the rehabilitation services available at the community level and set up community coordinating institutions to make it sustainable. 
To put the system into practice, Handojo integrates the community-based rehabilitation service in the Village Health Post (Posyandu) and Community Health Centers (Puskesmas). He mobilizes health providers and village health cadres to be able to conduct early detection in child development and deploy referral services. He also developed manuals for early detection, diagnose and referral mechanism and set up training for trainer system for village health cadres andhealth professional level. From a single health sector, the idea has evolved to influencing multi-sectoral change that empowers diffable to access and benefit from education, employment, health and social services and engaging people with disabilities, their families, organizations and communities, relevant government and non-government health, education, vocational, social and other services. 
In mid 80s, World Health Organization launched a similar idea internationally and in mid 90s the idea has been replicated by many countries around the world. To further meet diffable rights to quality of life, Handojo found the challenge in the tourism industry where it's not yet diffable friendly. In early 2000 Handojo started to develop the platform by engaging international tourism stakeholders in the concept discussion. For the idea he established an organization named RENA for Barrier Free Tourism for the diffable and the elderly. He envisions the tourism industry have diffable friendly infrastructures, recruits diffable as potential workforce and integrates new curriculum in the schools of tourism on barrier free tourism.",https://www.changemakers.com/ashoka-fellows/entries/rena,,,,
11,11,11,Noor Huda Ismail,Indonesia,"In the midst of emerging radicalism often leading to terrorism, Noor Huda Ismail is developing the means to reincorporate former terrorists back into Indonesian society by bringing them through a reconciliation process, allowing them to safely transition back into their communities and for them to live normal and productive lives.",Yayasan Prasasti Perdamaian,"In 2007, the International Crisis Group (ICG) reported that the deradicalization program in Indonesian prisons has succeeded in making two dozen former Jamaah Islamiah (JI) members cooperate with the police. Additionally, 450 terror suspects were sent to jail.  By 2012, however, the police have arrested more than 700 terror suspects and 650 people have been sentenced, incarcerated, and already released. However, around 225 of these people have unfortunately returned to their network and were apprehended once again for their involvement in terrorist activities at a higher level. It is estimated that around 200 detainees, which is double the amount in 2012, will finish their sentence and will be released in 2014. The government has been routinely successful in finding terrorist suspects and sending them to prison. Often, however, this practice allows them to connect with each other and reinvigorates recidivism to begin by taking place inside the prisons.
Urwah, for example, was sentenced to three years in prison for concealing a Malaysian terrorist, Noordin M. Top. He was only considered to be one of the “cheerleaders” in the periphery of the terrorist network when he was first sent to jail. However, once in jail, he became more radical and upon his release he amplified his role, acting as an executor of several bombings. Noordin was killed during a police raid in 2009. The teachings and the strong bonds established between the terrorists inside the prison led to continuing interactions outside. The prisons also allow anyone to visit the detainees. For example, those who have been released make regular visits to ensure that the detainees maintain their commitment to radical causes. As terrorists, they are placed higher in the social hierarchy of their groups and thus receive solidarity support through prison visits from their friends, relatives, and admirers. This support has enabled them to maintain their spirit of jihad.
A great number of the detainees were actually sympathizers who became involved on the fringes of the radical movement, in contrast to the ideologues and actors. They were detained and sentenced for minor and more supporting roles in terrorist activities; some were even carrying out tasks such as delivering messages without even knowing what the content of the message was related to. As it stands, the prison system in Indonesia is not well prepared to deal with convicts of terrorism; there is no system of separation of terrorists from other criminals, and the interactions within the prison create an open market place for ideas to spread. Those who were initially only sympathizers become more deeply indoctrinated by the influence of ideologues. These people are also recruited and maintained for deeper involvement through kinship, discipleship, worship, and/or fellowship.
Furthermore, the Ministry of Justice does not have effective post-detention care to assist the released prisoners on reentering society. Upon their release from the prison, the ex-detainees are left isolated, given no support or rehabilitation. In addressing the problem, the police use a reactive approach; apprehend the same or new terrorist suspects once they've committed terrorist acts again, whereas many NGOs do not even attempt to work on the issue of ex-detainees, either on the basis of prejudice or perceived risk. The resulting marginalization and discrimination of ex-detainees was identified as one of the factors causing them to seek out their former colleagues upon their release. All of these factors contribute to their recidivism. In fact, the Bali bombers were initially sympathizers who were recruited and then “promoted” as operators. Noor Huda perceived the Bali bombings as a conceivable entry-point for him to start working on the problem.","Noor Huda, by understanding that in the terrorist network there are different groups with different roles, focuses on eighty percent of the potential and existing terrorist groups, which includes three main groups: control groups that mainly consist of young students in Pesantrens (Islamic boarding schools), “cheer leaders,” those who operate on the fringes of the network, and the operators themselves. The remaining twenty percent are made up of the ideologues, which are considered to be the most extreme, and are thus unreachable. The network is based primarily on social interactions where individuals are tied to each other through their kinship, discipleship (teachers/supervisors), worship, and friendship. By breaking down these bonds, Noor Huda tries to shift their existing alliances. 
In reaching out to them, Noor Huda is developing different processes in accordance to where these groups are in the terrorist scouting process, such as the consecutive stages of pre-detention, detention, or post detention. In the pre-detention process, Noor Huda develops a tracking system in which he learns from the dossier, by monitoring the court, by studying the integration, and by cross checking with the level of pre-detainees former network. Noor Huda further observes their level of engagement in the network and creates a “heart connection” at the detention stage. This allows him to influence the former detainees and to change their network at the post detention stage. As an early detection system and to develop a counter-narrative against the ideologues, Noor Huda reaches out to young people at the Pesantren, the secular high schools, and the Rohis (Student Islam Group). Through different activities including journalism, training, and civic education, Noor Huda is promoting critical thinking and character building, especially for malleable young students who can be easily swept into the terrorist network by the radicals. 
Noor Huda is building a more humane, alternative model to rehabilitate ex-detainees by attempting to re-integrate them into society. This stands in contrast to the current government's security-based approach, where upon their release the ex-detainees are monitored by intelligence officers and are required to periodically report back to the authorities. Noor Huda applies the Jesuit approach learned through some of his schooling, to win their hearts, hands (welfare) and heads (ideology). He is introducing meaningful employment for the ex-detainees at different levels, which range from being cooks in kitchens to managers at offices. These outlets, which are led by the ex-detainees, employ young people who are dropouts, orphans, or economically disadvantaged. In the terrorist networks, this group has the potential to be a different kind of cheerleader. In Islam, caring for orphans and the poor is important, which appeals to the ex-detainees. Furthermore, it allows social interaction with a wide array of customers and a sense of responsibility for others. Gradually, the ex-detainees open up to different values, new perspectives, and new networks.",https://www.changemakers.com/ashoka-fellows/entries/yayasan-prasasti-perdamaian,"Jl.

12,12,12,Panut Hadisiswoyo,Indonesia,"Mount Leuser National Park, one of the largest national parks in the world, is also one of the most resource-diverse ecosystems. When national park authorities are challenged with emerging social problems, Panut Hadisiswoyo is developing a holistic, integrated approach, where local communities are the front liners to park management in Indonesia.",Orangutan Information Centre,"As one of the largest national parks in the world, Mount Leuser National Park is a conglomeration of several smaller nature reserves and forests covering 1,094,692 hectares of land. This land is serving the ecosystem for at least 4 million people residing by and nearby the national park. The park conserves a variety of habitats, including mountainous terrain, swamps, beach forests, lowland rainforest and alpine forest. The variety allows for enormous biodiversity within the park. There are nearly 8,500 plant species and 700 animal species residing in the park, including the critically endangered two-horned Sumatran rhinoceros and the Sumatran orangutan. Like many other national parks, its habitats are threatened by human activities. One of the biggest threats to this particular national park is deforestation, which occurs to make way for agriculture and plantations, the main crops being palm oil and rubber trees. Moreover, there is a lack of understanding of the national park's policies. Increasing the importance of mitigating these issues is the fact that the Gunung Leuser National Park is one of the last refuges for the Sumatran Orangutan. There are only an estimated less than 7,000 members of this species left in the wild. Some efforts to reduce forest encroachment have been put forward by relevant government agencies since the 1990s. The Indonesian government has allocated US $ 2.5 million to manage the park, but sadly there is little evidence of this impact on the ground. The problems remain unresolved, as many programs were not designed in a holistic way and disregard local communities in the forest management.
When actions have been taken to address the park management problems, it is often only done through a silo approach. Organizations focus either on a particular species without consideration for the people in and around the area, or on particular geographies within the national park, an approach that is favored by most donors. For example, an organization that is working only on Orangutan survival will focus on “rescuing” the Orangutans they found in the villages and taking them to a rehabilitation center that they built. There are many similar activities run by different local citizen sector organizations; however, they are spread across various buffer zone areas, leading to mismatched priorities and an unintegrated approach. 
The most serious and most short-sighted consequence of this deforestation problem is the loss of biodiversity as the destruction of tropical forests means the extinction of thousands of species and varieties of plants and animals, many of which have never been catalogued scientifically. The disappearance of the forest is also eroding biodiversity, a precious resource that also serves to sustain the livelihood for many forms of living things. People in small villages surrounding Gunung Leuser National Park often have no alternative livelihood options other than logging (both legal and illegal), poaching, or taking a job on an agricultural plantation. This, in combination with unclear boundaries and terms of public land use, has further exacerbated the problems of deforestation and poverty in Indonesia, even within protected areas such as the Gunung Leuser National Park. Disempowerment of the local community in forest protection and management has contributed to the shrinking forest and biodiversity. Since the local community has been disregarded as decision makers and are often seen as intruders, they do not have a sense of ownership towards protecting the forest.
Sumatran orangutans and other wild animals living in the national park are critically endangered due to ongoing deforestation and degradation of their rainforest habitats. As the rainforest is increasingly converted for cultivation, the frequency of human-wildlife conflict, such as crop raiding, increases. The animals utilize the crops as food resources in communities adjacent to the national park. The traditional park management has failed to address this issue because they only focus on the flora and fauna of the park, not the people living around the area. The business sector has made the conditions even worse. Local palm oil entrepreneurs are trying to make incursions into the park, illegal logging has continued to happen, and trade in exotic animals has increased, threatening not only the wild animals of the park, but also the livelihood of the people living around it.","While others have focused on creating a silo approach, Panut has been creating broad based partnerships that compliments and builds on limited capabilities of the local park authority. Using a people-centered approach, Panut has shifted park management practices. His partnership with the Mount Leuser National Park on forest restoration inside the park, which is run and managed in coordination with the local community, has become a positive precedence for other park management authorities and civil society organizations to improve their own national park management. With his model, Panut is working with the Ministry of Agriculture on how to upgrade the performance of national parks in Sumatera. In spreading the model, he developed partnerships with citizen base organizations in Malaysia and Thailand for them to be able to build broad base partnerships with the national park authorities.
From Panut's experience as a researcher in the national park, he realizes that drawing in and creating dynamic opportunities in what is known as “the buffer zone area” for the local people is important. Panut is promoting public awareness to halt deforestation through grassroots educational programs and by empowering local communities living near the last remaining orangutan habitat to work towards a more sustainable future for the forests. He has embarked on bespoke training to build the capacity of local communities to encourage the community to act on behalf of their environment.
Panut has developed early detection systems for resolving conflict before its negative effects can be felt in the national park. For example, he has trained 150 Moslem preachers to use Quranic verses supporting conservation during their religious teachings. Through environmental curriculum development, Panut has partnered with over 300 schools, reaching out to more than 15,000 students and engaging them in conservation camps run by the schools. He has also started joint community ranger and park ranger patrols to secure the vast lands of the national park. With other organizations in North Sumatra, he has set up new regulations on mitigation of human-wildlife conflict. By creating this holistic approach, Panut's organization (The Orangutan Information Centre -OIC), has gained trust from the Ministry of Forestry, Ministry of Internal Affairs, and local government to work with the communities living by the park.",https://www.changemakers.com/ashoka-fellows/entries/orangutan-information-centre,,,,
13,13,13,Lian Gogali,Indonesia,"With the experience of previous violent upheaval, Indonesia's diverse culture, ethnicity, and religion remain potent areas of communal conflict. Lian Gogali, a native to Poso which is an area of persistent conflict where religion is used to satisfy political interests, has created a method for trauma healing and cultivating empathy by which women and children transform themselves from victims, into survivors, and peacemakers.",Institut Mosintuwu,"Despite entering a democratic transition, violent internal conflicts have simmered across the country after the fall of the Suharto regime in 1998. The violence is estimated to have displaced more than a million people and led to the loss of thousands of lives. After a decade of communal violent conflict (1998-2007) in Poso, Central Sulawesi, which was chiefly the result of religious differences, people still bear personal trauma, mistrust and prejudice towards other beliefs and religions. An exodus of internally displaced people resulted in segregated communities – with Muslims centered in Poso and Christians in Tentena. The segregation occurred despite Poso's long history of religious communities living alongside one another. Post-conflict people preferred to stay within their religious community, rather than return to their original village. A traumatized Christian woman, for example, who used live in Poso now lives in Tentena, and feels uneasy staying longer than a few days in Poso when she visits her mother. Over the years, these segregated communities have seldom engaged in communication or dialogue. Government or civil society organizations have tried to mediate through workshops and seminars. However, these efforts were not effective due to a mismatch between local needs and unsustainable programs.
Despite their extensive role in managing conflict, from the individual to the community level, women have a limited participation in peacemaking endeavors at higher levels. Women were the greatest victims of the armed conflict and displacement. In the midst of violence and insecurity, they must care for their family and children. At the same time, nonetheless, women were active in reconciliation between the conflicting parties at the grassroots level. Through their economic activities and community networks they helped prevent further societal disintegration. They often connected otherwise segregated communities. They provided safe places for other families when villages came under attack. However, gender challenges have been institutionalized in a narrow religious and cultural interpretation of women's role in society. Women are still considered to be second-class citizens, with no voice or institutional experience in the peace building process. As a result, the conflict resolution process misses a wide range of perspectives and understandings of the stakes associated with violent conflict including how to address gender issues.","Lian has been creating processes that separate religion from conflict, and thereby prevent conflict in religious communities. The process goes beyond religious leaders and involves women from the community who use interfaith dialogue and deep empathy to heal the wounds of conflict. It allows women to understand politics relative to their role as peacemakers. This approach is considered new to the Indonesian context where religious conflict is deep-seated. For the process to take place Lian developed the Women's School, where female post-conflict victims and former religious opponents come together, first and foremost, as friends. Women start with a discussion of daily life, where they share personal narratives and discuss their position in society. The school furthermore allows women to experience healing and new reflections on conflict, gain social and civic training, speak their mind, and deliver messages of peace. They build trust while having interfaith and peace dialogues amongst different ethnic and religious barriers (Muslim, Christian, and Hindu). As a grassroots movement, the Women's School is set to be sustainable; using personal resources, the students run the classes. Some of the graduates have also become leaders in the school and facilitators for new students. Having spread across over 24 villages in four sub-districts of Poso, the graduates have now become local facilitators for religious tolerance, peace and gender equality through initiatives in their home communities. Through the Women's School, Lian has set up a network of Interfaith Women's Organizations, which are set to become the platform for other women's organizations, such as the Women's Congress, where women gain influence in policymaking.
Because conflict in the region is mainly across religious lines, women cannot heal unless they use interfaith dialogue and communication. Recognizing this, Lian created bridges so that women and their communities could heal the wounds of religious conflict. She developed a mobile library initiative at the “boundary” of religiously demarcated communities, through which children from various religious and ethnic backgrounds come together. For the mobile library project, Lian uses books as a medium to build trust and learn diversity. She also mobilizes high school students from five schools in Poso to run recycling activities as a means of exercising interfaith and peace dialogue. These children, who have brought their parents into the process, have become a concrete example for the adults that they could heal through interfaith and peace. Due to its success, the Women's School received attention from local politicians and government, which will further aid the Women's School in becoming involved in the peace-building process in Poso. Lian plans to soon insert the Women's School concept into Christian worship at church prayer groups, as well as Muslim prayer groups (majelis taklim). 
Lian's work is not just about peace, it is about the long process of cultivating empathy and advancing civil rights through various means including Women's Congress. Through the School, women engage each other through empathy, learn to be leaders for their community, and provide influence to the wider society. The process has transformed women from the role of a victim to that of a peacemaker, therefore preventing future conflicts and minimizing trauma. The graduate women involve themselves in village development processes such as setting up protection homes for women and children who are victims of domestic abuse. They also take local and political leadership positions as Village Heads, Village Development Planning Bureau and District House Representatives. Additionally, this school is in early partnership with the local Customary Institution to review gender issues in Customary Law.

14,14,14,Tanjung Niasari,Indonesia,"Average school enrollment has increased across Indonesia's diverse archipelago, yet two million Indonesian children still don't have access to primary school education. Tanjung Niasari, a psychologist, is providing means for children of island minorities to maintain their motivation in order to obtain schooling with the support from their parents and community members.",Lembaga Motivasi Obor Dunia,"Indigenous language education seems to serve as a way to both perpetuate traditions that are currently being lost and help replace marine-based livelihoods that are rendered obsolete due to changes in lifestyle.
The Bajo people, with an estimated population of 250,000 in Indonesia and 900,000 in Southeast Asia, are indigenous to maritime Southeast Asia. In addition to being nomadic boat dwellers, they are inshore and land-based peoples. They live a seaborne lifestyle, adapting to the rich maritime environment and to the island ecosystems. Even though widely dispersed geographically, the Bajo people are a united ethnic minority who are linked by strong bonds of kinship, marriage and language. Over the past decades, the Indonesian government appears to have put pressure on nomadic tribes to resettle and become more integrated into society. This has resulted in a denigration of seafaring traditions and a change in the day-to-day life of nomadic peoples. Recently, over 100 nomadic peoples were detained by the Indonesian government for not having identification, an event that highlights the precarious situation of these individuals who do not really consider themselves to belong to any one country. Although they have settled down, Bajo communities are still mostly isolated from mainstream society and continue to make a living from the sea.
Their unique culture, life-style and social isolation often results in discrimination and prejudice toward them. As exploitative fishing techniques, such as the use of poisons and explosives, proliferated in the 1990s, it resulted in extreme reef degradation. This poses a significant problem for Indonesia as a nation, given the amount of coastline the country has and significant ties between the marine environment and the economy. Recently, this issue has attracted the international attention of the organization Greenpeace, which is launching a 2013 initiative based on a 2012 internal study that focuses on the problems of overfishing in Indonesia. Because their livelihoods are dependent on reef health, the Bajo could potentially play a pivotal role in spurring conservation initiatives. However, the government does not see the connection between this important role and developing educational resources for the Bajo people in an effort to improve their understanding of the marine environment. Organizations such as the Indonesian Ministry for Marine Affairs and Fisheries are starting to develop education programs for children of fisherman, believing this would be a means to decrease social stigma the general public has of these communities, but has not formally linked with the Bajo communities.
Government engagement has encouraged the Bajo's relocation and assimilation. However, the sedentary resettlements have had minimal impacts in terms of education. For example, there are currently only 100 young Bajo people with secondary and university degrees. But even these young individuals find it hard to secure formal employment. Due to their dispersion, only limited public services such as schools, health centers, and support for their indigenous institutions, are made available to them. The same problems also occur across the smaller islands in Eastern Indonesia, from eastern Kalimantan and Sulawesi, to Maluku and the Philippines in Southeast Asia, and along the Lesser Sunda Islands, where the Bajo populations also live widely dispersed,.
There has been limited support for the development of indigenous institutions. Although primary schools are available in the village, preschool education is not provided and Junior and High schools are only found in capital cities of sub-districts. Due to geographical and cultural constraints, the access of the Bajo children to the existing schools remains very low. Furthermore, their attendance is often irregular and their performances are considerably poor. Only a few complete their Junior and Senior years of High School, and even fewer receive a tertiary education. In the remote areas, the teachers are often absent for several days at a time. The ratio of teachers and students is disproportional which limits the possibility of stimulating interaction and learning. The teachers are also inadequately trained and lack the understanding of developmental psychology. Evermore, the teachers themselves lack the enthusiasm and motivation when carrying out their jobs and do not believe in the potential of their pupils. 
The early educational environment for children of the disadvantaged strata of the society, including families and communities, discourages children from learning. This results in a lack of motivation from Bajo children and lack of encouragement and support from parents and communities, leading to high dropout rates among Bajo students and high levels of illiteracy within the communities. Uneducated parents do not see the value and benefits of education. They do not envision a better future and do not believe in themselves, let alone in their children. There is a culture of acceptance of the current situation and a sense of skepticism towards the potential for change.","Tanjung is instilling for the first time the motivation for education among island minorities that are most overlooked by development efforts, but yet are critical to Indonesia's future. The Bajo people, an ethnic group known as sea-gypsies, live everywhere throughout the far-flung islands of Indonesia. By working with them, people can approach other tribes that are more local, such as the Tolaki, who also live there. 
In bringing about motivated students for schooling as well as adults for life resilience, Tanjung has built a bridge for empathy through her Rumah Motivasi (House of Motivation), which is a non-formal kindergarten for the deprived communities. The school aims to give children of poor neighborhoods, in Kendari city and villages in many small remote islands on the Southeast Sulawesi coast, a chance for a better future. Tanjung initiated small learning groups for young children to build the motivation and self-confidence needed for learning. Her pedagogy model uses cognitive psychology teachings and patterns and the mind-mapping approach through the arts (songs, dances, puppet shows and paintings) to teach basic literacy and math. She also teaches children how to think and enables them to master their basic skills in reading, writing and counting. Believing that the best teachers are often the most overlooked, Tanjung identifies and trains teachers and volunteers from these ‘no hope communities'. After these teachers finish teaching at school, it is made compulsory for them to teach other poor children in the afternoon.
Tanjung builds capacity in these communities. For example she has set up an early childhood education program for the younger children of facilitators, local women and mothers. In planning, setting up and managing the Rumah Motivasi, she has to work with members of the local community, and therefore, also indirectly helps build capacity in that community. In order to sustain the initiative, these local motivated learners are also supported to run small businesses, which is key to their alternative livelihoods. As an attempt to reach out to other marginalized and discriminated communities, Tanjung is preparing to partner with the Ministry of Education for Eastern Indonesia Region to allow her model to be replicated as a part of the government's early childhood education program.",https://www.changemakers.com/ashoka-fellows/entries/lembaga-motivasi-obor-dunia,,,,
15,15,15,Maria Loretha,Indonesia,"In a country where rice has been the staple food of a nation since the national rice program was introduced during the Soeharto regime in the 1980's, Maria Loretha is striving to decrease the dependency towards rice and replacing it with local crops that have higher nutrient content and are easier to grow in the dry lands of Eastern Indonesia.",Yayasan Cinta Alam Pertanian,"The national high yielding rice movement that was introduced in the eighties during the Soeharto era turned out to be a disaster for the dry land farmers in Eastern Indonesia. In the western parts of Indonesia, where there is constant water supply and rain, rice can be harvested up to three or four times a year, while in Eastern Indonesia due to the lack of rain, it can only be harvested once a year which has also lowered the quality of the rice harvested. This movement has caused the disappearance of nutritious crops such as sorghum, red rice, black rice, jewawut (millet) and jelai (barley). Rather than having a variety of crops to grow, the government urged the farmers to grow only one crop. This has led the government to have tremendous control over the crops and also the inputs involved such as fertilizers and pesticides that needed to be ordered from outside of the eastern areas, which in the end has led to corruption from the government over the inputs involved. 

As the system continues and the rice movement is no longer enforced, the farmers are technically free to grow anything they want. The government has even started a movement which they call “Go Local” and “No Rice Day” to support the local food program, but it has been inconsistent without movement at the grassroots level. What farmers continue to see is the existing rice program, in addition to a government partnership with big companies to encourage the planting of transgenic corn in an effort to show their support to alternative food other than rice. However, this has instead proven the government to be insensitive to local problems. The transgenic corn could not grow well in Eastern parts of Indonesia. The inputs needed to grow transgenic corn were again controlled by the government. In the end, the farmers had to grow corn, sometimes with the support of the government, but most of the time without their support.

Even as the government encourages people to eat local food, they have not taught the farmers what to grow and how to grow it. While they introduced the transgenic corn, the local corn was never made a part of the local food movement. The farmers are left on their own to recover their seed patrimony and to find the low cost, high nutrition varieties they used to cultivate. Most of the elders in villages still have some of the seeds and the knowledge, but the farmers have not been growing these plants for a long time. The knowledge is lost to farmers and will be forever lost to the next generation if these practices continue.","Maria Loretha has recovered local knowledge that has been missing for more than thirty years by re-introducing local crops such as sorghum, jewawut (millet), jelai (barley), red rice, black rice, and corn, local foods that are more nutritious than rice.. These crops were uprooted during the national rice movement, which greatly contributed to the malnutrition issues faced by eastern Indonesia for many years. The low inputs that these local crops require are ideal for the dry land of Eastern Indonesia, and they can be harvested up to three times a year, unlike rice that can only be harvested once a year because of the soil conditions. example herself and has helped the farmers by showing them how to farm these local crops.
Through her training, Loretha is learning about climate conditions and understands that promoting local food security is part of surviving these changes. She believes that by maintaining local food diversity, island communities are able to be resilient against inconsistent food supplies from outside their regions. Together with the government, she is starting a national movement for sorghum and other local alternative food that is built on small farmers' organization at the grassroots level. These farmers organizations are based upon local self sufficiency, knowledge sharing, mutual support and an inter-island knowledge sharing network.
In 2007, Loretha started her quest by traveling from village to village in Eastern Indonesia in an attempt to find local seeds that have been missing for many years. She has managed to collect ten out of the thirty varieties of sorghum seeds and many other local seeds. She is now building the independent capacity of the small farmers groups to recover and disseminate knowledge about the local seeds, thus turning the farmers into innovators in her pilot areas in Kalimantan and Halmahera.",https://www.changemakers.com/ashoka-fellows/entries/yayasan-cinta-alam-pertanian,,,,
16,16,16,Hanisah Hanisah,Indonesia,"In the province of Aceh in Indonesia where conservative Islam has a strong hold, Umi has successfully advocated for and increased the number of female religious leaders, and through them, has managed to advocate and protect the rights of women and children.",Dayah Diniyah Darussalam,"Aceh is the only province in Indonesia that uses syariah law (Islamic law), making the roles of ulamas very important. An ulama is an Islamic scholar who has completed several years of training and study of Islamic disciplines. They are regarded very highly in society and hold important roles not only in the decision making process of the province, but also over social activities. Ulamas in Indonesia congregate through a forum named Majelis Ulama, a forum traditionally dominated by male ulamas. During the Prophet's Mohammad's time, women and men were held equal. There were several women during the Prophet's time that held important roles in the society, especially through their role as ulama. Unfortunately, a few centuries after the Prophet passed away, women's position in Islamic society started to decline back to the pre-Islamic period, which was lower than men. Women were relegated to their homes and their only role was to serve their husbands and raise their children. Women were seen as objects to be owned and women ulamas were again almost impossible to find. Indonesia's male dominated culture has misinterpreted the role of women through the perspective of Islam. Ulama positions in Indonesia are still dominated by men, therefore very few women become ulamas as they have to face myriad challenges. These women are now fighting against the discrimination that they have had to face for many years.
The challenges and discrimination women face are not just externally in society, but also in their marriages. In Islam, marriage just by religion (nikah siri) without the consent of the law is prohibited and has become common practice in regions of Indonesia where the majority is Muslim. According to Islam, a man is allowed to have up to four wives. Without their legal status in marriage, women are without their legal rights as a wife, leading to the high number of domestic abuse and rape cases in the province. Many Islamic countries have reformed their laws, banding polygamy practice in their countries. Indonesia is one of the few Islamic countries that has not reformed their syariah laws. Since Aceh is the only province in Indonesia where the syariah law is still applied, a movement trying to change this custom, coming from this region in Indonesia where religious women leaders advocate for women's rights and social change would have far more credibility and force.
The problems that women in Indonesia face are not just limited to Aceh or connected to Islam alone. The movement that has started in Aceh has become part of a broader movement that has reached all parts of Indonesia. Women ulamas outside of Aceh, although still limited in numbers, have more freedom to speak up and more influence in their society. These women ulamas have opened relationships with the women ulamas of Aceh, and together they have held several trainings to produce even more women ulamas throughout Indonesia.","In a region that is male-dominant, Umi is creating the space for women to hold important roles in their society. Through her work, an increasing number of women ulamas (religious leaders) are using their unique position to address fundamental social problems in the region, such as gender inequality and child protection. Umi has managed to pass a qanun (law) where in a Majelis Ulama (group of religious leaders), at least thirty percent of the members have to be women, where before only men were members. By increasing the number of female ulamas, Umi is ensuring women have a stronger voice in their societies, and their own lives.
Umi is addressing male and female relationships within marriage, because in Islam, women do not have the same rights as men in a marriage. A man is allowed to have up to four wives and nikah siri, or marriage without legal consent is commonplace in conservative Islam regions, leaving the woman with no legal rights and leading to higher numbers of domestic abuse, not only to the women but also to their children. Umi has succeeded in persuading the provincial government to pass a mandate that requires pre marital consultations with the Religious Affairs Office for the potential husband and wife and in the province, opening up opportunities for women and children to have a voice in the family.
Looking ahead, Umi has scaled her initiatives beyond Indonesia. Through the Ulama Forum that was held in December in Aceh, attended by ulamas from Indonesia and other Islamic countries in Southeast Asia, she has brought the thirty percent women ulama law a national discussion, pushing it to be recognized not just in Indonesia, but also in Malaysia, Philippines and Thailand. She also plans to use this forum in the future to bring about discussion of the pre-marital consultations law.",https://www.changemakers.com/ashoka-fellows/entries/dayah-diniyah-darussalam,,,,

Known as the father of food science and technology, he has established the field of food security and localized job opportunities in the food processing industry.",MBrio Food Laboratory,"Indonesia's 25 million low-income citizens consume less than 70 percent of the recommended dietary allowance of kcal/capita per day. They have an unbalanced diet, consisting of a high contribution of rice and wheat, with low consumption oftubers, vegetables, fruits, soybean, and meat products. Inadequate energy intake combined with poor food quality leads to low productivity, particularly among people living in rural areas. Furthermore, over 100 million people in Indonesia face micronutrient deficiencies, including iron, vitamin A, and iodine deficiency. These deficiencies affect pregnant and breastfeeding mothers and their newborn and infant children most significantly.
Food security and processing has not been fully developed in Indonesia. There are no educational programs devoted to the science and advancement of the food industry. Furthermore, Indonesia has no policy securing food availability, accessibility and consumption.The government's Green Revolution policy was developed to promote rice--a shift from local food--as the staple crop across Indonesia.The new policycaused 90% of Indonesians to rely heavily on rice as their main source of energy despite other affordable, local food options that are more nutritious. The resulting escalation in price of ricehas made it difficult forlow-income citizens to afford it. Decreases in local food production in combination with these high prices have been incredibly detrimental to society. 
The growing food industry in Indonesia raises concerns aboutthe safety of fresh and processed food products. Textile coloring and dangerous substances, like formalin, are widely used by small-scale food businesses that make up 99.9 percent of thewholeindustry. Indonesia has no institutions in place to standardize or monitor food safety, whichis essential for the food trade, both domestically and internationally.","F.G. Winarno has established the field of food safety and security using a three-pronged approach: shaping food safety regulations, providing job opportunities to small food production businesses, and supporting education and research in academia in order to build a future core of experts in food security. 
Seeing the need for progressive legislation to compliment the development of food science and technology, Winarno advocated for a new food law in Indonesia. In 1996, the Indonesian government passed Food Law 7/1996, the basic regulation on food safety and security that ensures a sufficient food supply for all Indonesian households. This legislation served as the legal basis for food security regulations passed in the following years. 
In collaboration with the Ministries of Health and Women's Empowerment, Winarno developed a community-based campaign to support local food. In addition to providing nutritional support for pregnant women and infant children, Winarno promotes breastfeeding as the best nutritional food source for newborns. He also recognizes the importance of supporting small and micro food businessesto improve food safety.Winarno's work with street-food sellerssupports the application of new food processing technologies.
While Winarno has laid the groundwork for food safety, Winarno still sees a challenge in the need to improve food security in Indonesia.  Hefounded the Indonesia Food Laboratory Association (ALPI) in 2011to expand the network of accredited food laboratories available in the country. With the ALPI, the growing number of smaller food processing businesses can prosper. That, along with the new researchWinarno has supported will push Indonesia's food industry to meet international food standards.",http://www.mbrio-food.com,,,,

Estimated around 300,000 in Indonesia and over 5 million globally, people live with SLE This number could increase drastically as many people cannot yet be detected. Furthermore, the symptoms vary greatly from person to person. The prevalence rate per case is amongst 500-1000 people with women have a much higher ratio than men (9 women : 1 man) during their productive years (15-45). Even though it has been found since the 13th century, SLE is still incurable. Currently the average 10-year survival rate has been more than 90% compared to less than 50% of 5-year survival in 1955. 
Nonetheless, the mortality rate could be pushed further down when there is early diagnosis and treatment for LSE, and drug medications are accessible and affordable. Odapus in Indonesia are still struggling unfortunately, as there is no system in place to support them. In the medical service, there are not a lot of doctors aware and have the skills to conduct early diagnosis. Or they may take a long time to diagnose, since the symptoms come and go and mimic many other illnesses. 
Due to the challenge, Odapus often have misdiagnosed and got mistreatment. No procedure operating system is in place for the health providers, especially in public health clinics to handle the suspected patience. For those who have been diagnosed, medical drugs prescribed by the doctors are expensive and inaccessible especially for Odapus who are poor and live in remote areas. The lower income bracket would otherwise let the disease untreated as they are unfortunately cannot afford the doctor fee nor the medication.
While medical science has not yet developed a method of curing lupus, very few researchers have the interest to bring new findings to support the lives of Odapus. Although there are already attempts done by the government and different organizations to promote Lupus, the general public is still not aware of the disease. Some are not able to identify the symptoms and others do not know how to help. In addition to the medical challenges, psychological problems like stress and depression are common in Odapus. Moreover, some Odapus have to also deal with impaired vision (from low vision to blindness). Many Odapus and low vision become unproductive labor force and quit from their job, or students are absence from their school. Some organizations set up peer support group, however they are exclusive.","The Idea
While others focus on campaign and building exclusive community of people living with Lupus (Odapus) or SLE (Systemic Lupus Erythematosus) –a systemic autoimmune disease, Dian is building the supporting system where Odapus and Low vision (LV) could live longer and healthier. To ensure the health system is available, Dian works with the District Health offices assisting doctors and nurses at the sub-district health clinics aware of SLE and improve their skills in early diagnosis and treatment. She has also partnered with 100 volunteer doctors for Lupus (Dokter Pemerhati Lupus) who then set up Health Center for Lupus in different public ehospitals (Yang men set up Lupus centre adalah para dokter pemerhati Lupus).
As medication and laboratory test are costly, Dian engages pharmacies and laboratories to provide discounted price for Odapus. She is also proposing  to  the Health Ministry, pharmaceutical companies and hospitals to ensure the equal distribution of drugs for Lupus for the poor and in remote areas. In mobilizing public support for Odapus, Dian engages researchers to find immunosuppressant from natural resources. While doing a creative campaign by selling among others music album, audio book and Ring Back Tone on Lupus, Dian is mobilizing people to support her work sustainably. Currently about 500 Odapus joined in her Lupus Community and set up online peer support group to facilitate communication and information exchange from Odapus in remote areas including those who live abroad. 
In addition to working with her Lupus Community to spread her work and connect to other groups, Dian has also been working with the Health Ministry to develop operation guidance to address SLE including among others planning in Ministry resources deployment, preparing Ministerial Decree for drug pricing and distribution control, Standard Operating Procedure and referral system for hospitals and health clinics'.",http://www.syamsidhuhafoundation.org,,,,
19,19,19,Suprio Guntoro,Indonesia,"In the absence of appropriate technology to alleviate rural poverty, Suprio Guntoro, a researcher, introduced an ecological techno agriculturesystem to farmers in Indonesia.",Bali Tekno Hayati Foundation,"Approximately 70 per cent of Indonesia's population lives in rural areas, where agriculture is the main source of income. Nonetheless, 16.6 per cent of rural people are poor compared with 9.9 per cent of urban populations. Millions of small farmers, farm workers and fishers are materially and financially unable to tap into the opportunities offered by Indonesia's years of economic growth. They are often geographically isolated and lack access to appropriate technology, agricultural extension services, markets and financial services.

Most small-scale coffee growersin Bali own 1-1,5 hectares of land with most or all of it dedicated to coffee production. Coffee is a long-term investment for most growers as it takes 3-5 years for a coffee tree to bear fruit and they remain productive for 30-100 years depending on the variety and local soil and climatic conditions. Nonetheless, most farmers are trapped in mono-cropping practice where scarcity of land and lack of knowledge and resources to diversify has left them extremely vulnerable to coffee price fluctuations on the global market. During 1999-2003 the coffee price (Robusta) went down drastically to one third of the regular price. The provincial government anticipated the drop of the coffee prices by introducing goats as an alternative income. Unfortunately, the government did not provide the farmers with the knowledge needed to take care ofand breed the goats. Due to miss-breeding management, which resulted to smaller and weaker kids,when the goats caught scabies, most of them died. 

In other coffee growing areas, the drop of the coffee price has swayed farmers into changing coffees with seasonal crops. Nonetheless, the new seasonal crop farming practice has resulted flooding and landslides in rainy season and drought in the dry season. The roots of the seasonal crops could not hold the soil strong enough compared to coffee trees. The shift of the farming practice will further jeopardize water scarcity for irrigation and clean water, not only for the surrounding communities but also the cities.

The problems the farmers face in productivity has been in the application of conventional farming model, which is a result of the green revolution that even though has increased the farmers welfare, has led the farmers to heavily rely on external inputs.They have to buy fertilizers, pesticides, seedlings and feed from other islands, which is not cheap and often difficult to get. The government then introduced the techno farming system intensifying various farming technologies. However,the model was highly risked. Besides only focused on one dominant commodity, the model put aside the sustainability of the agricultural natural resources. The government also introduced a harvesting technique that requires water to wash the coffee beans. Yet, the technique was not appropriate, as there was not enough water available. Alternatively, civil society organizations promoted theeco-farming model that applies traditional technology to conserve species biodiversity and sustainable environment. Alas, the model resulted to low land productivity and thus lessened the profit of the farmers.","By filling the gap in access to appropriate technology, Guntoro is enabling a system for coffee farmers to develop their diversified agribusinesses, the government transforms they way they provide the services, and farmer prepareyoung people as farmers' future generation. 

Departing from impoverishment due to the downfall of global coffee prices, Guntoro engages farmers to apply new farming system techniques that diversifies crop commodities, integrates multiple species and recycles livestock and crop waste. Not only that it gives economic values through farmers' productivity and efficiencyandecologically sustainable, it also lowers the risk of farming (disease attacks, price fluctuation, etc) and provides adaptation and mitigation measures adjusting to the climate change.

For example, in the village in Bali where he is piloting, farmers now combine growing coffee as the annual crop and ginger as the seasonal crops in the hedgerow. They also breed goats to integrate into the farming system where the goat manure is fermented to become crop fertilizers, pesticides and biogas. Coffee leaves from pruning are used for goats' feed. Thisclosed production cycle mechanism can also be applied to other combinations such as rice paddy-fish-cows, coffee-goats-bees, cashew nuts-corn-goats, or cows-ducks-rice paddy. By applying this new practice, farmers have now gained 1,500 folds of income from only 200 thousands to 2,9 million IDR per month. 

Guntoro has also facilitated farmers to become pioneer farmers or local agents of change. Farmers engage other fellow farmers through training run by farmers themselves to replicate the model in other areas. The farmers also train high school students to cultivate future farmers as a strategy of reverse urbanization. Guntoro is also working with the farmers to develop agro-tourism program inviting wider public to be exposed to and learn about the application of the appropriate technology. Currently 4,000 farmers spread across Bali already applied the model and at least 1,000 farmers voluntarily came to learn at the farmers' training centre. 

Detaching from the loan sharks, farmers now run their farmers' groups. There are already 200 groups where farmers do collective marketing and pricing. Together with the farmers group, Guntoro is currently working on obtaining export commodity certificate so that farmers can get the export price for the coffee.The model, which is called by the government Simantri program,has now been adopted by the Bali provincial Agriculture office and is already replicated in 150 villages across Bali, with 200 new villages for this year's target. In partnership with the Directorate General of Agriculture in Jakarta Guntoro has started to introduce and spread his ideas throughout Indonesia, among othersto the provinces of South and West Sulawesi, West Sumatera, Lampung, Bengkulu, Aceh, and others.",https://www.changemakers.com/ashoka-fellows/entries/bali-tekno-hayati-foundation,,,,

Nearly half of Indonesia's 240 million populations live in malaria endemic areas, where eastern provinces are with the highest incidents. Despite decades of malaria control efforts, more than 500,000 morbidity cases, with an estimation of 900 people died per 100,000 populations, are reported in 2009 by WHO. 
It is also claimed that 90% of those who died are children. However, children who survive an episode of severe malaria suffer from learning impairments and brain damage, even could lead to poor childhood development when experience repeated episodes of malaria. Pregnant mothers and their unborn children also face risks from malaria. Not only that did it affect the health and the lives of the people, Malaria also exacerbates poverty due to medication expenses.
In the province of North Maluku, people do not know malaria, let alone recognize its signs and symptoms and how it's transmitted. For hundreds of years, they otherwise associate malaria symptoms with myths and take the patients to shaman. Healthcares in the village, when there are, unfortunately do not have the capacity to treat patients neither have medical equipment to do blood tests. Health Clinics on the other hand are limited to only 30 centers serving people living across 400 islands in the district of South Halmahera alone. Due to this geographically barriers, which imply high transportation cost, people would rather leave the patients untreated. 
Since 1950s, government interventions to control malaria have been in curative approach. Malaria breeding sites still spread across the neighborhood. Especially in South Halmahera, people lives in coastal and swampland areas which are the natural breeding sites for Anopheles mosquitoes. Government infrastructure services such as sanitation and roads, have been however developed in a top down approach which does not meet the community needs in eliminating malaria.","Since the 2003 outbreak occurred in many villages in South Halmahera, which claimed 267 lives, dr. Moh urged that eradicating malaria is everyone's responsibility. He then reversed the way the government used to addressing malaria's control, away from top-down to bottom-up where community members take the lead in controlling the mosquito-borne disease. Through the establishment of Village Malaria Committee, Dr.Moh has created channel for community members to understand how malaria is transmitted and its causes, recognize signs and symptoms, improve preventive collective practices and treatment–seeking behaviors. This has resulted to no outbreaks for the past three years and in many areas there have been zero cases in infants and pregnant women.
To strengthen the local initiatives, dr. Moh developed an integrated system for malaria prevention engaging different government offices including among others District Planning Bureau, Village Development Bureau, Fisheries District Office, Public Works Office, Education Office and Health Office. He co-founded Malaria Center as means to coordinate all institutions. He and his colleagues advocated the Provincial and District Governments to issue regulations that allow all government institutions to collaborate.

Odapus in Indonesia are still struggling unfortunately, as there is no system in place to support them. In the medical service, there are not a lot of doctors aware and have the skills to conduct early diagnosis. Or they may take a long time to diagnose, since the symptoms come and go and mimic many other illnesses. 
Due to the challenge, Odapus often have misdiagnosed and got mistreatment. No procedure operating system is in place for the health providers, especially in public health clinics to handle the suspected patience. For those who have been diagnosed, medical drugs prescribed by the doctors are expensive and inaccessible especially for Odapus who are poor and live in remote areas. The lower income bracket would otherwise let the disease untreated as they are unfortunately cannot afford the doctor fee nor the medication.
While medical science has not yet developed a method of curing lupus, very few researchers have the interest to bring new findings to support the lives of Odapus. Although there are already attempts done by the government and different organizations to promote Lupus, the general public is still not aware of the disease. Some are not able to identify the symptoms and others do not know how to help. In addition to the medical challenges, psychological problems like stress and depression are common in Odapus. Moreover, some Odapus have to also deal with impaired vision (from low vision to blindness). Many Odapus and low vision become unproductive labor force and quit from their job, or students are absence from their school. Some organizations set up peer support group, however they are exclusive.","The Idea
While others focus on campaign and building exclusive community of people living with Lupus (Odapus) or SLE (Systemic Lupus Erythematosus) –a systemic autoimmune disease, Dian is building the supporting system where Odapus and Low vision (LV) could live longer and healthier. To ensure the health system is available, Dian works with the District Health offices assisting doctors and nurses at the sub-district health clinics aware of SLE and improve their skills in early diagnosis and treatment. She has also partnered with 100 volunteer doctors for Lupus (Dokter Pemerhati Lupus) who then set up Health Center for Lupus in different public ehospitals (Yang men set up Lupus centre adalah para dokter pemerhati Lupus).
As medication and laboratory test are costly, Dian engages pharmacies and laboratories to provide discounted price for Odapus. She is also proposing  to  the Health Ministry, pharmaceutical companies and hospitals to ensure the equal distribution of drugs for Lupus for the poor and in remote areas. In mobilizing public support for Odapus, Dian engages researchers to find immunosuppressant from natural resources. While doing a creative campaign by selling among others music album, audio book and Ring Back Tone on Lupus, Dian is mobilizing people to support her work sustainably. Currently about 500 Odapus joined in her Lupus Community and set up online peer support group to facilitate communication and information exchange from Odapus in remote areas including those who live abroad. 
In addition to working with her Lupus Community to spread her work and connect to other groups, Dian has also been working with the Health Ministry to develop operation guidance to address SLE including among others planning in Ministry resources deployment, preparing Ministerial Decree for drug pricing and distribution control, Standard Operating Procedure and referral system for hospitals and health clinics'.",http://www.syamsidhuhafoundation.org,,,,

These centers are the first of their kind in Indonesia, providing holistic services to both autistic children and their families.",Rumah Autis,,"The New Idea
Deka Kurniawan has been trying to assist autistic children and their parents by developing Rumah Autis. His main concern and idea is how to  mobilize resources (financial and non financial) in which autistic children from poor family can enjoy various service such as therapy, specific need education, life skill training and boarding. He  mobilize financial resources through collecting donations from various efforts such as individual donations,  Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) fund, local government budget, and  developing business unit. Around  60 percent of Rumah Autis budget is collected through  individual donations.  
Although initially Rumah Autis only recruit  autistic children from poor families. However  in its development it  also recruit autistic children from the  rich family.  These changes are possible because there are demand from  rich parents to accept  autistic children from well off family.  So there are two kind of autistic children parent in Rumah Autisnamely those who have and those who have not.  The first have to pay Rumah Autis's services at normal price. It contribute 40 percent of Rumah Autis annual budget. The latter  can contribute in line with  their ability to pay.

There have been more than 24.482 HIV/AIDS cases reported with 4.603 people died. Of cases reported, more than 50% were people under 30 years of age, and a growing number of infants who contract the disease through the womb or from being breastfed. In addition, the epidemic of injecting drug use continues to be the primary mode of transmission, accounting for over 50% of HIV infections.
Risky sexual behaviors and exchange used needles amongst the Injecting Drug Users (IDU) have increased the likelihood of HIV/AIDS spreading to the general population. Awareness of HIV status among at-risk and general populations is low. Furthermore, stigma and discrimination persist and many people living with HIV hide their status for fear of losing their jobs, social status, and the support of their families and communities. It has been thus decreasing the likelihood that they will receive proper treatment and increasing the chances of HIV spreading undetected. 
Limited knowledge about HIV/AIDS amongst government officials and medics and lack of knowhow in medical treatment has furthermore caused hospitals to reject patient with AIDS. Those who have been infected are unable to afford the antiretroviral therapy (ART).","When the government was still in denial that AIDS cases existed in Indonesia, Syamsurizal and his doctor colleagues have already initiated the AIDS movement since the 1980s. He started by sharing information in reproductive health to students whom he thinks the highest risks with the lowest knowledge in HIV/AIDS. Through the endeavor, he cultivated student peer counselors to do outreach to programs. Currently hundreds of high schools in Jakarta and other cities across Indonesia are replicating the model. 
At the grassroots level, Samsuridjal develops community-based prevention of mother to child transmission, which was first started in Jakarta. Over years the program has been replicated by different organizations in 6 provinces, Banten, West, Central and East Java, South Sulawesi and Papua. By developing workshops function as center of HIV/AIDS, he builds community support for persons with HIV/AIDS (PLHIV). The workshop has given the birth of HIV support group initiated by the late Suzana Murni (Ashoka Fellow). 
Simultaneous with the public education and community support, he cofounded the Special Study Group for AIDS (Kelompok Studi Khusus-Pokdisus) between RSCM Public Hospital and Medical Faculty University of Indonesia. He advocated the acceptance of AIDS patient in hospitals. Now almost every hospital would accept patients with HIV/AIDS, and capable in conducting surgeries when necessary. Many doctors have also been capable in diagnosis, indicated by how 70% patients in Jakarta come for treatment after reference from GP or specialists. Samsuridjal also led the advocacy for free ARV therapy, as most of PLHIV cannot afford. Over five years of continuous efforts since 1998 he has finally been successful in making the ARV generic produced by local pharmaceutical company, and provided for free by the government with the support from WHO.

24,24,24,John Rahail,Indonesia,"Even though there is an increase in school enrollment number, two millions of Indonesian children still experience primary school drop-outs. John Rahail, has created infrastructures for pre-school development and learning rooted in their locality and cultural based in Indonesia.",Institut Pengembangan dan Pemberdayaan Masyarakat (ICDp),"Indonesia has reached 94% primary education for children 7-12 years of age. Nonetheless, there remains 2 million primary school children are out of school. Regional variations exist, however, eastern Indonesia provinces lag considerably behind the rest of Indonesia in terms of education enrollment. Papua and West Papua Provinces, which are the lowest national UNDP HDI (Human Development Index), lag significantly behind the national rate at about 80% in primary school to 96% national average and about 47% at junior secondary to 91% national. Furthermore, the average years of schooling in rural areas, where 86% of the indigenous Papuans live, is only 2-4 years. Despite progress in the transition from primary to junior secondary school, only about 55% of children from low-income families are enrolled in junior secondary schools. 
Indonesia's legal framework meets most requirements to guarantee the right to education. However, access and quality of education in Papua provinces are far below national standards, in spite of countless government programs to address education challenges have been taken. Government applied standardized education model with perspective unfamiliar to local people. There has not been any attempt to align the learning model with local traditions and customs. When other parties tried to develop alternative model, they are unfortunately run in a project basis with hardly any continuation. The quality of the teachers is moreover insufficient and put the children purely as passive recipients. All of these have lowered children's motivation to go to school. 
Although mandatory school fees were recently abolished, the associated costs of schooling - uniforms, books, transport and lunch money - continue to impact more heavily on parents' ability to keep their children in school. The major barriers faced by rural families are geography and subsistent economy. In addition, most rural people hold views about schooling as expensive and investment in it has no value—because it takes a long time to see results. Furthermore, education is viewed as cost and even threat of loosing the family's resources to take care of domestic work, such as, accompanying parents working at the crops or to the market, or stay home to take care of younger siblings. The rural community also considers education as urban modernization as once graduated the children will live in cities and leave rural agrarian lifestyle.","Through the development of Sekolah Kampung (village school), John has developed channels for pre-school children to pshychologically and physically ready to enter a learning culture in the aims to encounter high drop-outs rate in Papua. Through the model, John is instilling the interest of children to learn and therefore improve their self-confidence. A contextualized curriculum has been developed where John has converted traditional games into learning material, so that children wouldn't feel strange while learning new things. To maximize the learning result, John integrated children primary health measures. Practices such as eating nutritious food, washing hands before eating and after defecation and other basic personal hygiene practices have been introduced. 
John's model has shifted the perpective of the people, especially the parents, from being sceptical and against education to engaging in monitoring their children development and taking pride in their progress. Local mothers and youth become teachers in the Village School. Through village regulation, Village Head and Customary Leaders support by engaging other villagers as school teachers and health post cadres. Over 3 years of operation, the Village School has accommodated 372 children where 85 of them already enrolled in primary school.

25,25,25,Paris Sembiring,Indonesia,Two thirds of Indonesia's 120 million hectare forest is in critical condition. Paris Sembiring has created a business model that empowers and provides economic incentives for people from different backgrounds to get involved in seedlings development in support of reforestation movement in Indonesia.,Bank Pohon,"Indonesia has the third largest extend of the world's remaining tropical forest. Nonetheless, rapid and high rate of excessive deforestation and land conversion to smallholder or plantation agriculture has made half of Indonesia's forest in critical condition. Past estimates of the extent of degraded land in Indonesia have ranged widely—from 12 to 74 million hectares.
People living at the local level have the most immediate effect from deforestation. With forest loss, the local community loses the system that ensures the regular flow of clean water and protects the community from flood and drought. When forest cover is lost, runoff rapidly flows into streams, elevating river levels and subjecting downstream villages, cities, and agricultural fields to flooding, especially during the rainy season. During the dry season, such areas downstream of deforestation can be prone to months-long droughts. However, there is almost an absence of people living close to the forest participating in reforestation, let alone those who live in the city who may have no direct impact of deforestation. 
Government attempts to restore forest cover have had a low success rate, despite considerable public expenditure. Ministry of Forestry has just launched the annual one billion trees planting program in degraded land. Nonetheless, ripe seedlings are not available for the planting season. The actual result thus showed less than 10% seedlings planted has survived and thrived. Low quality of seedling being used, which is not ready for planting, accounted for the failure. 
Incorrect tree planting techniques applied by people engaged in the reforestation exacerbates the problem, as they do not have the required knowledge and skills. Furthermore, there has been an absence in post-planting care. Even though the government has developed 10.000 KBR (Citizen-based Seedlings Garden) throughout Indonesia, which each should meet 50,000 seedlings supply per year, most seedlings failed to grow due to wrong nursery technique. Unfortunately, most tree planting activities conducted by both government and civil society organizations, are merely ceremonial and thus unsustainable.","Paris saw an untapped opportunity for everyone to participate in reforestation while gaining economic incentive from the activities. Responding to the huge needs for Indonesia to cover the degraded forest, Paris initiated the development of tree nursery movement, run and owned by community members. 
With the idea of ‘Tree Bank' Paris engaged farmers, young people, students, teachers, and scavengers to establish groups of environment cadres to produce high quality seedlings in a self-sufficient mechanism.  Paris organized scavengers to collect seeds from the juice street vendors, of which some are sold to the environment cadres groups and the rest they use for their own nursery. In Medan he has mobilized 80 scavengers who have earned much more than collecting recyclables. Paris also established and trained 150 farmer groups who then joined his network. From these nursery businesses the groups have gained profit projection up to 500%.  To date, Paris has assisted more than 16,000 environment cadres who formed 400 groups in 10 provinces throughout Sumatera Island. To improve seedlings sales and catch wider market, Paris helped the groups established Association of Plant Breeders.
Paris saw the importance of youth and education institutions for the reforestation movement. He then worked with different schools, university, playgroup and kindergarten. He assisted high schools and established Student Group of Environmental Lovers, an extracurricular club for students to get involved in greening activities. Moreover, the activity has been integrated in the biology curricula where students learn how to produce superior seedlings, conduct tree planting around the schoolyard and maintain the plants.  To widen the movement, Paris is currently working on spreading the model to other islands beyond Sumatra.",https://www.changemakers.com/ashoka-fellows/entries/bank-pohon,,,,
26,26,26,Hokky Situngkir,Indonesia,"In a fast changing environment people are demanded to be able to adapt by which knowledge has become the power to survive. By utilizing the untapped cross-sector and multi disciplinary knowledge, Hokky initiated the application of complexity science to address human needs in Indonesia.",Bandung Fe Institute,"Indonesia is the world's largest archipelago with a population of 240 millions spread across 13,667 islands. In today's increasingly competitive world economy, Indonesia is struggling to maintain and expand its economic opportunities as it fails to keep pace in knowledge acquisition and dissemination. Despite Indonesia's diverse population thus rich in knowledge, with considerably low level of education, nonetheless, people have less access to knowledge and the skills to use the knowledge effectively. 
In a fast-changing environment people are demanded to be able to produce constant innovation, to be constantly adapting, and be in a state of continual evolution, if they are to survive. Such needs are hardly to achieve, as people tend to be passive knowledge consumers than producers although there are extensive sources of knowledge that could be used to produce innovations. The linier way of knowledge use and production has furthermore hindered people to be able to address complex problems. 
Among the small business holders, for instance, traditional batik designs have transmitted from generation to generation mostly through oral tradition. Traditional knowledge in Indonesia's diverse culture can actually be utilized as a value added to people's asset. With complex impact of globalization, however, there are no preventive or anticipative measures to keep the knowledge in batik and other traditional art works as a continuing promising source for creative economies. In addition, along the modern living, this untapped knowledge has not been furthermore utilized as an innovative source for new knowledge or culture reproduction. The public participation in the collection and use of traditional knowledge, especially amongst younger generation, is very low. Archipelagic geographical landscape makes furthermore hard to interact collectively.
In addressing human needs in such a complex system, policy makers on the other hand applied sectoral or single disciplinary approach. For example, one of the recent government poverty alleviation programs where government provides cash giveaways hasn't solved the problem, even created other problems of financial dependency. Even though the government has provided an increase budget over the past two years, the poor population has only declined for 2.1% from 15,4% in 2008 to 13,3% in 2010. Influenced by unpredictable global economy, the government has no anticipated tools or systems in times of crisis to secure the country's macro and microeconomics.","Hokky has created systems and tools for ordinary people, business practitioners and policy makers to utilize existing multidisciplinary knowledge and translate them into practice. With the system in place Hokky has enabled people to move away from solo discipline to interdisciplinary problem solving mechanisms in different fields such as macro and micro economics, disaster management, sport, health, corruption, conflict mapping and creative economy to mention a few. People address their needs by extending their analytical and predictive abilities to complex phenomena and equipped by recent advances of computational technologies. It therefore allows people to think creatively about ways in which scientific findings could shape values, institutions, leadership, participation, and policy-making processes in community life. Instead of being knowledge consumers, people are now able to become knowledge producers that boost further innovations.
One of the examples of the system Hokky has put in place is how young people could participate in collecting, preserving and utilizing traditional art works such as batik designs, music, songs, dances, architectures which are potential for creative economics as well as fostering diversity and tolerance. For this together with his organization Bandung Fe Institute, Hokky set up IACI (Indonesian Archipelago Cultural Initiatives). Through the establishment of www.budaya-indonesia.org web portal he mobilizes young people to build the Indonesian Traditional Culture Heritage Encyclopedia. Some new small businesses have emerged from the initiative where people produced new batik fractal designs.
In addition to helping private companies in developing their Investment Portfolio, he furthermore set up a new system of crisis management protocols at the Ministry of Finance. The protocol, which is later distributed to other related Ministries before financial crisis occurs, is to rescue or mitigate the country's finance from regional or global economic crisis' impact. He also facilitated the Ministry of Youth and Sport for the national badminton teams to develop a winning strategy based on win-loose projection.

27,27,27,Vinsensius Nurak,Indonesia,Climate change is further challenging the livelihoods of over a billion poor and vulnerable people living in the world's drylands. Vinsensius Nurak has empowered farmers in eastern islands of Indonesia to transform drylands into productive ecosystems securing food sustainably.,Yayasan Mitra Tani Mandiri (YMTM),"Among Indonesia's 230 million populations, 87 million are food-insecure and Indonesia's eastern province of Nusa Tenggara Timur (NTT) is one of the country's most food insecure. In the drought-prone mostly rural province of 4.5 million people spread out over 50 islands, the average per capita income is $265 a year, which is way below the poverty line. Government's 2009 data claimed NTT the country's highest rates of under-five children diagnosed as chronically malnourished (as measured by height-for-age) or acutely malnourished – 46.7 and 20 percent, respectively, as compared to the national average of 36.8 and 13.6 percent, due to food insecurity and feeding practice.
Nonetheless, in the drier eastern islands of Indonesia, food production is still largely focused on meeting subsistence needs. With slash-and-burn and shifting cultivation system, food production could only feed farmers and their families for ten months in a year. After having been cultivated and got exhausted in 2 years, the land is left for 10 years allowing farmers to return, otherwise the soil will be permanently unsuitable for farming. With longstanding environmental degradation this farming system is less productive per hectare than irrigated system as it needs about 10 times the area to produce the same volume of food. Regrettably, as extreme climate change occurred in 2011, the farmers could only produce crops and secure food available for only 7 months. The problems have been worsened by local improper storage system where farmers should experience seeds preservation failure for the following planting seasons and food losses due to pest problems of maize weevil (Sitophilus zeamais). 
Despite chronically vulnerable, government treated malnutrition and food insecurity with short-term solution such as rice giveaways. None has yet addressed the interrelated problems of crops production, feeding practices and malnutrition. The Agriculture Office, for example, would focus on hybrid maize seeds provision support. Besides very much sectoral approach, it raised problems in timely seeds distribution as they arrived when the planting season was over. The Food Security and Agricultural Extension Agency have also mobilized agriculture extensionists to stay in the village to help farmers with agricultural technology and information. Nonetheless, most of them are not willing to be based in the village. Alternatively, many local and international civil society organizations have worked with farmers to improve agricultural productivity though still sporadically spread across the area. In terms of market, farmers still have no bargaining power since the middlemen will set the price. And when cash is needed, farmers will go to money lender for small loans and are trapped by high rates of interest.","While others provide short term and sectoral measures to address pervasive poverty in rural drylands, Vinsen has introduced a new livelihood patterns. Through a holistic approach, farmers successfully increased crops production, developed crops storage system and improved nutritious food consumption. Thirteen thousand farmers in 4 districts across East Nusa Tenggara Province and in the neigboring Country of Timor Leste have now shifted their slash-and-burn cultivation to sedentary farming. With the new practice, all year long food is secured and the environment is sustainably managed. By leaving subsistence farming for agroforestry, farmers' household income have increased and malnutrition amongst children under five has been addressed. 
Vinsen has mobilized farmers to set up groups to work on the crops together, conduct collective marketing, savings and loans and post-harvest production activities. Almost 300 farmer's groups formed 25 farmer's group association across over 100 villages across 4 districts in NTT province. Together with the farmer groups Vinsen and his organisation (Yayasan Mitra Tani Mandiri/YMTM) have built 8 small dams and have harvested water to cultivate vegetables which contributes to improve nutritious food. The farmers also improved cattle fattening management and gained net profit of IDR 1,284,000/head/11 months (USD142), which is three times more than before. They also established saving and loan groups with a total cash flow of IDR 450 million (USD50,000) releasing farmers from high interest money lenders.
With the success, Vinsen's model has been adopted by TTU District Head and replicated in all TTU's 175 villages. The TTU District Head selected 4 local civil society organizations to implement the model and engaged Yayasan Mitra Tani Mandiri to provide assistance. Vinsen's model has also inspired the Ministry of Welfare to change the implementation of Government's Rice Giveaways for the Poor program. Before receiving routine rice donation, farmers who work in groups will develop the agroforestry. In partnership with different organizations, Vinsen is currently developing a mechanism for farmers able to do long-lead climate forecasting and develop local coping and adaptation strategies to avoid crops failure.",https://www.changemakers.com/ashoka-fellows/entries/yayasan-mitra-tani-mandiri-ymtm,"Kefamenanu Tengah, Kefamenanu City, North Timor Tengah Regency, East Nusa Tenggara, Indonesia",+62 388 31760,-9.442288,124.474697

Harry Suliztiarto, a rock climber professional,  pioneered the safety system for workers at height in Indonesia.",Asosiasi Rope Access Indonesia (ARAI),"In 2007 the Government reported 7 workers died everyday from 95,000 work accidents amongst Indonesia's 100 million work force. Falls from height (60 centimeters or higher)  accounted the biggest cause of workplace deaths and one of the main causes of major injury. Although the Government had issued legislations and complementary regulations to ensure work safety since 1970, work at height (WaH) sector has not had yet any legal basis for companies and workers to comply to the safety standards.     
Within the work at height career path, most workers are unskillful and untrained. They are therefore underpaid regardless types of work challenges and employed daily as needed. In addition, most companies do not equip them with any safety toolkits. Those who already use safety equipments, however apply inappropriate techniques and equipments that still raise potential accidents. Considering less cost, most companies are in favor of providing budget for work accident compensation than safety equipment purchase. This is partly due to most safety equipments are imported from United States, Europe and Japan, which made them expensive. Though Indonesia has produced the equipment locally, the government is not confident yet to provide standard certification due to the absence of mechanism and infrastructure to test and certify the products.","For the system to take place, Harry developed the infrastructures to ensure safety of the workers at height, advance the profession and thus develop the sector. He advocated work-at-height regulations and helped Ministry of Labor to set up institutions to enforce the regulation. By establishing training and safety certification system and institutions, Harry is improving workers' professional knowledge and skills. To thrive the work-at-height profession, he designed 4 level work-at-height competencies so that workers can be paid based on skills obtained. To date, over 100,000 workers-at-height have certified by certification companies.
He also established a nation-wide professional association of workers at height (ARAI) to facilitate workers' exchange ideas, knowledge and skills. To address the issue of high cost imported safety equipments, Harry is advocating government to develop National Certification Bureau as an authorized certification institution to test and certify local safety equipments.
Harry set up safety operational standard for companies, including employee recruitment, safety equipments and work techniques. He successfully made government issued the regulations in personal protective equipment and safety standard operating procedure. The new regulation implies a new position of safety manager in companies responsible to oversee the implementation of safety standard. The Ministry of Labor has also set up work-at-height division and mobilized new 100 supervisors to monitor the implementation of safety standard at company level. To boost the development of work-at-height sector in Indonesia, Harry founded an association of work-at-height experts (A2K2BT) as a think tank body engaging companies, workers union and government representatives.",http://arai.wah-indonesia.org,,,,

Communities facing these circumstances become largely apathetic, with little public dialogue or collaborative problem solving initiated. 
In these poor urban communities, life for those classified as “troublemakers,” includingex-convicts and recovering drug users,is even more difficult than for most. Stigmatized because of their past, and without effective institutions helping them, these marginalized individuals face the danger of recidivism, and relapse daily. Facing poor job prospects, and lacking marketable skills, their outlook is often bleak.Weakened, these people have even less opportunity to develop their own communities, and their potential to create change often remains untapped as problems worsen.","With impoverished urban communities largely disengaged from public participation, problems often go unaddressed in Indonesia's developing cities.

Addressing these issues, Reggihas developed a civic participation model for marginalized communities, specifically engaging and humanizingex-convicts, and other stigmatized groups. Creating democratic dialogue through forums, Reggi organizes andlaunchs action squads to solve locally identified problems.
As a result, injection wells have been built, murals have been created, public space has been reclaimed, and community waste collections have been launched, providing needed urban development at the grassroots level.

Widely held attitudes have marginalized and excluded the disabled from participation in society. Parents often view disabled children as a shame to the family, and a burden to society. Many such children do not attend school, in part because some embarrassed parents strive to keep them hidden from society, and in part because of the lagging supply of schools serving the special needs of the children. 
Gaining a foothold in the economy is difficult for those with special needs. Potential employers and the general public often discount the disabled, assuming they have few talents of economic or other value.  In addition, government policy to support employment of the disabled is more symbolic than effective. A modest policy requiring company workforces to consist of one percent disabled individuals has not been widely adopted or enforced. An overall lack of jobs and a lack of adequate preparation for employment opportunities further compound the problem.","Ciptono, a special needs educator in Indonesia, is transforming curriculum for disabled students, implementing vocational and entrepreneurial training to supplement academic learning. His work is producing self-confident graduates capable of becoming independent, and reshaping the public's view of what it means to be disabled. 
Though most schools emphasized academic achievement over any other forms of learning, Ciptono recognized this practice would not meet the needs of Indonesia's disabled children. In a radical departure from what other schools were doing, Ciptono has tailored each students curriculum based on their individual competencies. Once competencies are identified, based on demonstrated preferences, students can be placed into programs that provide training in a variety of fields including culinary arts, carpentry, automotive, beauty and fashion, IT, performing arts, agriculture, handicrafts, and electronics. Students also receive entrepreneurship education, enabling them to monetize their skills, and providing a pathway to economic independence. 
In addition to training, Ciptono's students also benefit from a wide range of therapy provided at school, and will soon benefit from a home therapy program where parents will be trained to provide basic therapy to their children. Ciptono welcomes visiting delegations to his school from countries around the region, and the replication process is currently underway. Representatives from visiting schools can complete “internships” to learn the curriculum, and how to best implement it at their own school. 
Ciptono's consistent advocacy and outreach to the community is changing the public perception of the disabled, and soon Ciptono plans to open a “House of Inspiration.” This gallery will both feature the work of the disabled and be staffed by the disabled, providing a way for the public to socialize with them.",https://www.changemakers.com/ashoka-fellows/entries/slbn-semarang,,+62 24 76744365,-7.042829,110.46611
31,31,31,Mia Sutanto,Indonesia,"Initially in Jakarta and now in a growing number of Indonesian cities, Mia is organizing mother-to-mother support groups that are encouraging mothers to opt for and helping them succeed in breastfeeding their children in accordance with international norms endorsed by the Indonesian government. Through those support groups and related advocacy activities, she is making important inroads in combating malnutrition—a major cause of infant and child mortality in Indonesia.",AIMI (Asosiasi Ibu Menyusui Indonesia),"Every five minutes a baby dies in Indonesia, and most of these deaths are due to malnutrition. Despite the superior health and nutrition benefits of breast milk in comparison to substitute products, in Indonesia only 32% of babies are breastfed until the World Health Organization's suggested minimum of six months of age. Even fewer children continue to breastfeed until the recommended age of two. Given the lack of breastfeeding mothers, the positive benefits associated with breastfeeding, including improved mental and physical health of both mother and baby, are not widely achieved.
Two decades of government efforts to increase the percentage of breastfeeding mothers have proven mostlyineffective.New mothers are often confused about what is best for their baby, andvery rarely have trusted resources and support to turn to. Though lactation counselors are available, access to them is generally restricted to Jakarta, and interested mothers are often unaware that they exist. Widely held but erroneous beliefs, e.g., that breast milk goes sour if the mother exerts too much energy, create additional obstacles that limit the use of breastfeeding.The misinformation means that in many respects, breastfeeding is no longer considered the norm. 
Worsening the problem, formula companies concerned with expanding their customer base and sales have marketed aggressively to new mothers through the use of gift packs, phone calls, and strategically-placed advertising. In many instances, disregarding international marketing codes, formula companies also develop close relations with doctors and other hospital staff members that result in their promoting infant formula as a healthy and sometimes preferable alternative to breast milk. But for impoverished women who decide to use formula, the results can be deadly; a need to stretch expensive formulas further often leads to a dilution or contamination of product that endangers the baby's health. 
Even though some women understand the benefits of breastfeeding, they often lack a supporting environment and infrastructure. In workplaces, an absence of appropriate facilities for pumping and storing breast milk can make it infeasible for women to continue to breastfeed when returning to their jobs.","In recent decades, with rapid urbanization, increasing employment of women in formal workplaces, and the availability and promotion of substitute “infant formulas,” breastfeeding newborn infants and young children is no longer the cultural norm in Indonesia.  Unfortunately, as a consequence of that change, the nutritional status of infants and children in low- and modest-income households has significantly declined.  Mia is attempting, with growing success, to combat those trends by encouraging and assisting the formation of mother-to-mother support groups that facilitate breastfeeding and by providing those groups with supporting services, including lactation counselors. Under the aegis of a volunteer-run organization that she formed in 2007, she is alsoengaged in related educational activities and in advocacy work with relevant government agencies, and with business firms employing women of childbearing age.  
Mia is strongly committed to expanding her work to a national scale. She has already recently extended her work to three other cities in Java, in addition to Jakarta, and plans are well advanced for launching three additional programs early next year that will extend the reach of her organization, AIMI (AsociasiIbuMenyusui Indonesia; Indonessian Breastfeeding Mothers Association).",https://www.changemakers.com/ashoka-fellows/entries/aimi-asosiasi-ibu-menyusui-indonesia,,,,
32,32,32,John Ndolu,Indonesia,"In much of eastern Indonesia, customary practices associated with weddings and funerals entail excessive expenditures and resulting indebtedness that gravely impede much-needed investments in education and other development needs.  Through a process of community dialogue, initially among his own ethnic group, John has succeeded both in replacing those traditional practices with modestly scaled ceremonies and vastly reduced dowries and in the establishment of a promising new vehicle for community investment in higher education.  He is now increasingly engaged in encouraging and assisting of the adoption of similar reforms in neighboring and more distant parts of Indonesia.",Forum Adat Peduli Budaya,"In several of the poorest provinces of Indonesia, customary law and longstanding traditions relating to weddings and funerals prescribe lavish expenditures that, more often than not, result in massive indebtedness that precludes investments in education and economic advancement and is often passed along to future generations. 
In the case of weddings, the bride's uncle determines the amount required for the dowry or belis. (Though the rate varies widely, it can sometimes reach 100 million Indonesian rupiah—some 11,700 US dollars at current exchange rates). To meet those very demanding monetary demands, the groom's family hosts a tu'u festival at which money and livestock for the belis are collected from invited relatives and neighbors. Because the tu'u festival involves several ceremonies that require the provision of lavish meals for the invited guests, hosting the event involves very substantial monetary outlays and the consumption of family livestock. And since collections from the event are considered to be ‘reciprocal gifts,' hosts are also expected to match those donations when the donors organize their own tu'u ceremonies (or similar activities, stretching over a 100-day period, associated with funerals). 
Despite hosting a large tu'u, there is no guarantee the event will raise the expected amount, and it often falls considerably short of doing so, but paying the full belis is compulsory for families of all financial situations, and because there is no time limit on fulfillment of that obligation, debts can be inherited from parents, or even grandparents—a practice that places some children in financial bondage when they are born. Individuals who are unable to pay their debts face public embarrassment, as they are admonished by the traditional leaders and often isolated from social activities in their communities.
The belis also has ramifications, beyond the loss of wealth or inheritance of debt, that have negative impacts the role of women in society. Because a bride is essentially ‘purchased,' often at an exorbitant rate, the belis creates a basis for male domination and provides a rationalization for the subjugation of women and for domestic violence against women, both of which are common practices. The second-class status of women diminishes the opportunities for girls to receive an education, as most poor families prioritize education for boys. 
Because the importance of the belis, the tu'u festival, and similar funeral ceremonies, is deeply embedded in the community, inclusive dialogue concerning the adverse effects of those practices has been extremely rare or nonexistent. And while those specific cultural practices are limited in geographic scope, analogous deeply ingrained practices are prevalent both in other parts of southeastern Indonesia and in some in the country's western provinces and in other parts of Asia and Pacific region as well. Serious efforts to discuss and combat their deleterious effects are non-existent or exceedingly rare.","John Ndolu, an elected Chief of the Kunak ethnic group on Rote Island in East Nusa Tanggara, is keeping community values intact while simplifying centuries-old traditions that encouraged excessively lavish outlays for dowries and wedding festivities and for similarly costly funeral ceremonies. Having realized that the high costs associated with weddings and funeral ceremonies have long trapped the people of Rote and many other communities in eastern Indonesia in a vicious cycle of excessive outlays and consequent indebtedness, often resulting in the loss of land to money lenders and in failing to make much needed investments in the education of the affected communities' youth. 
Gathering key leaders to discuss those concerns, John asked for help in crafting agreements to transform lavish wedding and funeral ceremonies into more modest ones and capping outlays for dowries at much lower levels than those that had long prevailed. In addition John crafted, and is gaining increasing support for, a new savings vehicle that has already facilitated outlays for higher education for more than forty particularly promising young women and men. Over the past eight years, John has replicated this work, which began in his own and immediately neighboring communities, at the sub-district and district levels, and the reforms that he is advocating have now reached some 130,000 people. As a core component of his work, John has established a Local Customary Communication Forum to facilitate and monitor the new practices and to develop and impose sanctions for the noncompliant. And encouragingly, the spread of John's idea is demonstrating to Indonesia's burgeoning population, that even relatively isolated and conservative communities can indeed shed long-honored traditions that are demonstrably counterproductive.",https://www.changemakers.com/ashoka-fellows/entries/forum-adat-peduli-budaya,,,,
33,33,33,Erie Sudewo,Indonesia,"Corruption and poor stewardship have severely limited what reaches the poor in Indonesia. Erie Sudewo has revived the custom of giving, a religious duty in Islam known as Zakat, by creating a conglomerate of intermediary institutions, both for-profit and not-for-profit, that are honest, trustworthy, effective and innovative.",Dompet Dhuafa,"Currently, fourteen percent of Indonesia's population lives in poverty. Even though this number has decreased since the economic crisis of 1998, the government's poverty alleviation programs have not been able to end poverty, as they are more remedial. Donors provide funding for civil society organizations, however it has created dependency over foreign funding. Foreign support received during the dictatorship also brought with it political suspicion.

Indigenous philanthropy, however, has long been practiced in Indonesia. For Muslims there are different giving mechanisms. Charitable giving in the form of zakat (mandatory charitable contribution based on income) is one of the five pillars of the Islamic faith. The donation equals 2.5 percent (the rate mentioned in the Quran varies from 2.5 percent to 20 percent, but the widest-accepted rate is 2.5%) of a person's annual income (cash or otherwise), and is required of all Muslims who have resources remaining after meeting basic requirements of their families. Beyond an expression of gratitude Zakat represents a significant social redistribution of wealth. While zakat is the only required form of charity, additional voluntary giving is strongly encouraged and takes various forms, such as infak (a voluntary gift for a restricted purpose), sadaqah (voluntary charity for unrestricted purposes) and waqf (Islamic endowment, typically created by an individual). As a country with the greatest number of Muslims in the world who represent 90 percent of the country's population, there is a huge opportunity for people to utilize zakat to eradicate poverty.

However, the government has calculated that the amount collected today is less than 10 percent of the potential U.S. $100 billion per year that could be collected. Under the Soeharto regime, the state took control of zakat policy, including the management of collection and distribution of funds. In the 1990s a Zakat Bill under the Ministry of Religion was issued to regulate the zakat usage and the organization that manages it. Even though semi-government organizations (BAZ-Badan Amil Zakat) have been set up to collect and distribute zakat, the government's accountability and effectiveness in serving the poor has been questioned. Alternatively, under current government regulation of zakat, community based organizations (LAZ-Lembaga Amil Zakat) are given permission by the government only to collect zakat and then submit the funds to BAZ. 

Corruption in zakat management at BAZ and LAZ has resulted in people having no trust in zakat institutions and no longer being willing to pay the zakat. For some others, zakat has been forgotten despite its huge potential as an alternative social safety net for the poor. As far as policy and regulation are concerned, confusion, inefficiency, and competition for the funds have continued for decades. The Ministry of Religion has proposed a draft addendum of zakat management, which is still to be controlled by the Ministry of Religion. Multiple ministries have tried to control zakat.  Various reasons are given for this tug of war to control the money; some say it should be under the Ministry of Social Welfare due to its purpose, the Ministry of Finance due to the amount of wealth mobilized, or the Ministry of Religion due to religious motivations for the practice. All these ministries continue to have a stake in the new Act.","Erie has transformed the religious tradition of charity, called Zakat, to help the poor by forming new zakat management institutions, which offer high quality and affordable health, education, and savings/loan services. Most of the organizations develop financial independence and sustainability. Simultaneously, this umbrella structure has also allowed zakat payers to make independent decisions as to how and where to donate. In 2010 the zakat collected was more than one trillion rupiah (from 612 billion in 2007).. 

Through his efforts Erie has created a new wealth redistribution system based on an ancient one with tenets set in Islam. Erie has been the first and strongest advocate for citizen sector control of zakat management, run by staying true to the values of transparency and accountability. Through the establishment of an earlier charity, he modeled what citizens could do and do better than the government by setting up a civil society organization called Dompet Dhuafa (‘wallet for the poor') in 1993. 

Erie realized early on in his life that everyone has something to give to others but would not give it, at least through the government system, if they believed the system was corrupt or the process was too complicated. In 1997, Dompet Duafa launched Forum Zakat (FOZ) to create greater awareness about and improved management of zakat organizations throughout Indonesia. The forum encourages coordination and partnership at the national and regional levels and assures a high quality standard of zakat management. Erie set up the Institute of Zakat Management in 1999 to raise the number of citizen sector zakat collection and distribution institutions and supervise the quality of operations. Now, ten years after its establishment, 400-500 citizen-based Zakat Management Organizations have emerged across the country with millions of beneficiaries.",https://www.changemakers.com/ashoka-fellows/entries/dompet-dhuafa,,,,
34,34,34,masril koto,Indonesia,"Masril is meeting the financing needs of Indonesia's poor farmers through a hybrid cooperative bank owned wholly by them. Through this structure, Masril is creating a sense of independence, control, pride and ambition in the mindset of rural citizens by building on a spirit of collaboration and camaraderie.",LKMA Prima Tani,"Farmers account for 44.6  percent of Indonesia's total population. For decades Indonesia has been lauded (by the World Bank and regional development banks) as an agricultural success story  – for food security, for market-rate microfinance programs, for “getting prices right”. However, despite their contribution to the nation, most farmers are living under the poverty line. Among barriers to economic development, lack of access to capital is at the top of the list. The poorest, lacking any formal collateral, political or social clout, remain dependent on middlemen or moneylenders for financing. They receive advance payment before harvesting, which means loss of bargaining power. They also need financing for even simple postharvest activities like drying and storage. Poor farm households often use the advance payment for consumption and are thus trapped in a vicious cycle of poverty and perennial indebtedness. 

The current rural systems for finance and expertise upon which farmers depend are mostly city-based. Accounting for 80 percent of the financial sector, commercial banks actually have large amounts of loan funds. However, due to previous high non-performing loans during the financial and economic crisis of 1998 made loans to farmers risk-averse. Furthermore, the threat of harvest failure due to pests, climate, fluctuating prices, etc. has made the agriculture sector not creditworthy in bankers' eyes. The government has therefore offered subsidized loans to rural villagers, channeling the funds through banks that already have branches at the village level. However, due to complicated and inflexible credit application procedures, farmers cannot access this capital. Commercial banks strictly comply with prudential banking principles (i.e. character, capacity, capital, collateral and condition of economy), which make farmers' small, urgent and short-term loans seem economically unviable. 

Alternatively, the government's subsidiary loans for small enterprise development with no collateral requirements have also been channeled through commercial banks and micro-finance institutions or cooperatives. However, the absorption of the loans in agribusiness is still low. In addition, many of the loan programs are corrupt and never reach farmer groups. Government-run cooperatives were developed, especially during the Soeharto regime, through a top-down and centralized approach. Therefore, farmers developed a strong aversion to cooperatives. Their experience was that cooperatives only benefited caretakers, and were synonymous with corruption and nepotism.

Microfinance was looked upon as an effective model in reaching out directly to poor people and many citizen sector organizations set up microfinance institutions. The Government, realizing the need to make financial services more accessible to the poor, has furthermore begun to commercialize rural microfinance by encouraging viable and sustainable microfinance institutions. However, there are only a few that focus on providing financial services for developing farmers' agribusiness. Improving farmers agribusiness skills are not part of the service either, let alone providing information or education to farmers. The Central Bank alternatively has encouraged commercial banks to open new microfinance units. Nonetheless, these new services are not yet trusted by the poor. The banks would seize collateral if loans default. Other banks would only be interested in mobilizing farmers' savings, not in providing loans.","Masril initiated Agribusiness Microfinance Institution (LKMA), dedicated to village farmers' agribusinesses, in response to the lack of financial services for small farmers. The idea introduces capital agglomeration by combining banking financial products and a coop system. It sells shares and collects deposits while also offering savings schemes. Through this model Masril has engaged over 100,000 farmers and mobilized more than twelve million dollars of their financial assets in over 550 LKMA branches in south Sumatra province.

Indonesia is an agriculture-based country, recognized internationally for its macro and microeconomic successes. However, despite the government's efforts at “farmer empowerment,” subsidized financial schemes, commercial microfinance institutions, infrastructure and agribusiness development, farmers constitute over 50 percent of the nation's poor. Masril, a farmer himself, listened to other farmers and created a farmer-controlled solution that places the interests of the poor first. 

What is most striking about Masril's bank is the human resources structure. Farmers dictate the bank's offerings through their equity position. The young people are the mobilizers and are trained as bank managers. This provides them with jobs and confidence and, with meaningful employment, will keep them from migrating to cities. Elders and other respected citizens serve as advisors and mediators if disputes arise thereby acting as guardians of the system.

Besides amassing capital from farmers, this new financial system is a channeling scheme for other programs for farmers that increase their confidence. In line with farmers' seasonal and cash flow needs, credit schemes are set up, for example, to improve horticultural productivity and to develop post-harvesting small businesses. The bank also provides general loans to free farmers' land, which is usually set as a collateral to the moneylender. The credit is small and flexible in terms of repayment period, making the service competitive with conventional banks. So far the LKMA has realized a 90 percent repayment rate. However, to further minimize risks of non-performing credit, LKMA educates farmers in production techniques and household financial management, in addition to strengthening traditional values through regulation. New savings products are also developed, such as saving for pregnancy, education, marriage, or to pay motorcycle tax. Loans are given to the whole family as a way to secure the rights of women.

Masril has also  improv ed agribusiness productivity by training farmers, for example, in organic farming and in developing value-added agro products through food processing and improved packaging. On their own initiative, farmers developed learning centers for organic farming, organic goat and cattle rearing where the most successful farmers share their own experiences. To further broaden knowledge, Masril also set up libraries for farmers in the farmers' banks or in small coffee shops where farmers often congregate. To develop the library program Masril mobilized book donations from urban dwellers. “One Book for One Farmer” or “A Million Books for Farmers” campaigns are part of his strategy to build urban appreciation for rural contributions to the entire country. His message to urban dwellers is “you can eat because farmers are out there” and “you can be healthy and beautiful because farmers are growing food”. 

The Minister of Agriculture adopted LKMA as a key agriculture-financing model for rural agribusiness and rural development in 2008. With a pilot goal of 10,000 LKMAs nation-wide, Masril is overseeing the spread to Bali, Palembang, Bangka, Bengkulu and West Java. Masril is preparing the association of LKMA at West Sumatra provincial level which will accommodate the needs for intra-lending scheme and agricultural products transactions across LKMAs. He is currently also advocating for the adoption of the model by the Central Bank of South Sumatra Province.",https://www.changemakers.com/ashoka-fellows/entries/lkma-prima-tani,,,,

Ginan is putting HIV+ in charge of improving their life quality and public's knowledge about AIDS at the same time.",Rumah Cemara,,"By taking the lead, Ginan framed peer support groups to break from isolation, move beyond their circle of HIV+ and significant others affected (family, spouse, friends), reaching out to other high risk populations, and to wider public. Using football and music as a universal language, he facilitates people to people interaction as a mean to personally explain the truth about drugs and HIV – the infection and the people, to curb both the epidemic and the stigma. On the other hand, involvement in sport and cultural activities brings positive physical and socio-emotional impact to the group, and provides a mean to reintegrates the group to the society at large.

Historically, AIDS movement in Indonesia began first with campaign for awareness about AIDS and access for HIV+ right, such as the work of the late Fellow Suzana Murni. It's then followed by strengthening of the community, such as Fellow Daniel Marguari's work through peer group support. After an intensive work with IDU's and HIV+ access of health and more than 50 peer support network, Ginan realized how right now stigmatization is the greatest challenge. Though the epidemic has actually spreading out, and various campaigns are conducted, social stigma remains attached on this group, contributing to further spread. Thus this is the time for a counter movement, by proofing that HIV+ community can be like any normal people active in and contributing to the society.

Rumah Cemara office in 3 locations (Bandung, Sukabumi, and Cianjur) have built strong relationships with hospitals to encourage its members to seek health services and antiretroviral treatment. Their staff and members go to clinics and talk to people what kind of support they need, telling them about Rumah Cemara's programs and how they can join. They also encourage doctors to promote their football program. To sustain their leadership, Rumah Cemara facilitates HIV+ to gain economic development and resource mobilization skill. Ginan envisioned a world where all HIV+ and ex-addicts could become change makers, by bringing the change first to themselves, thus changing their label from a burden of the family into positive contributors to the society. Thus he's creating a critical mass of living example to move further to anti-discriminatory policy level.

Ginan also involved the developing network with public for resource mobilization. Rumah Cemara works with reputable universities to integrate campaign and fundraising in various student events.

Combining saving mechanisms with waste segregation, Bambang is using economic incentives to introduce waste management across Indonesia. The ensuing waste separation practices among households create sustainable revenues for recycling businesses.",Bank Sampah Gemah Ripah,"Rapid urbanization, uncontrolled population growth, and consumption changes have all contributed to an excessive generation of urban solid waste. City residents are suffering from the consequences in a variety of ways: a degradation of health and sanitation; a deterioration of the physical environment; and the long-term alteration of environmental mindsets. The recent landslide in Bandung city, which tragically killed 143 people, damaged 26 hectares of land, and costs the city millions of dollars in rehabilitation measures, underscores and exemplified the gravity of Indonesia's waste management problems.  
Both local governments and environmental groups have made numerous unsuccessful attempts to improve Indonesia's waste management practices. In 2008, for example, the Indonesian government passed Law No 18/2008 on Waste Management, which established a legal foundation for waste separation and community involvement in waste management, while also enabling the prohibition of open dumping. Implementation and expansion of the law, however, has been rudimentary and often nonexistent.
While environmental campaigns have increased awareness, concrete actions have yet to be seen. Only a small minority – who are mostly environmentalists – of households actually separates waste materials and recycle. In the few instances when citizens do recycle, the municipality is so fractured that the segregated materials are often remixed and transferred to the original dumping sites upon collection, thus vitiating any attempts to effectively manage waste. Informal material recovery facilities and recycling businesses also exist across Indonesia, but they are often unsustainable and poorly organized to have a systemic impact.","Bambang is working with communities to establish ‘waste banks' that serve as community-based recovery facilities. Waste banks collect materials from clients and resell them to the appropriate buyers. Moreover, the revenue is added to the client's ‘waste bank savings account,' thus creating an economic incentive for individuals and households to collect and recycle waste. In addition to reselling materials, many waste banks also operate as recycling business units, in which they convert recyclables and sell them as usable products (e.g. conversion of plastic packaging waste into handicrafts). 
Bambang's efforts have not only reduced the waste stream that is dumped into garbage disposal sites, but they have also eliminated illegal dumping and created additional job opportunities. In an effort to create generational change and alter mindsets, Bambang targets youth participation and asks parents to register their waste banks accounts in their child's names.

By improving around 3,000 villagers' quality of life and building trust throughout the community, Dr. Smits has provided powerful incentives for both long-term ecological and economic restoration.   Key to his model's success is the use of newly developed and sustained rainforest as a new source for fresh water, by both increasing and retaining more rainfall in the area. This is not only improved the protection from forest fires but also a increased the supply of clean drinking water to more than 30,000 people in surrounding cities. Dr. Smits has also created a water supply company with the local government to improve access to clean drinking water, with the profits being used exclusively to sustain the Samboja Lestari rainforest.   Dr. Smits' Borneo Orangutan Survival Foundation has not only saved hundreds of homeless and mistreated orangutans, it has also provided them a new long-term habitat in the wild. His palm sugar factory has been pledged by the government to be a national project and will be replicated in eight provinces in Indonesia. By providing alternatives and proper incentives for the local community – through the extensive efforts of his Masarang Foundation – he has also achieved both economic and political legitimacy, and has established a model for restoring forest habitats worldwide.",http://www.masarang.or.id,,,,

Through his organization, the Institute for Social Transformation (INSIST), Roem builds local institutions as centers of education for isolated, marginalized and minority communities in rural areas. INSIST's School of Social Transformation (SST) is dedicated to civic and economic rural education to empower community members to create social change. He educates them about customary rights, helps them develop economic and agricultural self-sufficiency, and nurtures local leadership to ensure that communities can mobilize against regional, national, and multinational economic and political exploitation in the future. Roem was the first in Indonesia to use tools of village mapping (of resources, problems, threats and opportunities) and video for community members to participate in critical analysis, problem solving and resource management. At the SST centers, community members can learn by physically implementing new sustainable agriculture techniques at the school's facilities. The educational process motivates people to create positive social change for themselves because they participate in identifying community problems and finding solutions. Once they achieve autonomy, these local institutions join INSIST as member organizations, integrating into a larger national network of citizen sector organizations that work with communities on minority rights, natural resource protection, women's empowerment, and other issues. INSIST's approach is both universal and community-specific: they will build the local institution with the community, providing resources based on the context and particular challenges of each place and people, while empowering community members with the universal skills of organization, advocacy, and leadership.",http://www.insist.or.id,,,,

B2W's goal is to introduce biking as an easy and healthy means of transportation by pushing for local governments to create bike lanes and storage places, providing a motivational support network of cyclists, and giving people access to safe, affordable, and convenient bikes. Toto is successfully bridging the gap between public issues such as pollution and health problems and individual lifestyles, encouraging people to recognize their individual role in larger social problems and participate in collective action towards solving these problems. He and the B2W community have empowered people by motivating them to take action on emission pollution and energy problems by simply cycling and reducing city traffic. B2W serves as a useful network, connecting people to each other to share ideas and help make public and private bicycle use more convenient, such as arranging for special bike parking at workplaces and collectively pressuring local governments to build city bike lanes. Toto began his strategy to convert Jakarta to a cycling friendly city by reaching out to poor urban workers, the group that still relies most on bicycles as an inexpensive means of transportation. Toto and his team then moved to generating a demand for bicycles within the middle class. The middle class is growing rapidly across Southeastern Asia, and is a difficult group to break into because the majority can afford cars, and rely on them as symbols of social status as well as convenience. Another target group is students: B2W has organized bike drives in schools to promote cycling as a mode of transportation for students and teach younger generations about the environmental problems Indonesia faces in the present and future. Toto's B2W community has spread throughout 31 cities in Indonesia, from Aceh in the far west to Papua in the Far East, and now has a diverse membership of 11,000 cyclists, including workers, CEOs, students, lobbyists, government officials. The movement has spread rapidly with the help of Toto's creative public media campaigns and by individual-to-individual motivation. Toto has also gained political leverage, reaching out to the President of Indonesia to get local governments' support for all B2W Chapters. The scaling of B2W is supported by a commitment to design new products and support the growth of bike businesses. B2W has developed and overseen the manufacture of affordable bike designs while bike shops, workshops and leasing companies for bikes are emerging throughout the country.",http://www.b2w-indonesia.or.id,,,,

He has connected harvesters from eight remote areas and helped create a platform for communities to participate in Indonesia's ongoing debate about how to balance a commercial expansion into forest areas. Communities on four different islands are now expanding the marketing success of forest honey. Heri has also partnered with the Non-Timber Forest Products-Exchange Program to replicate this model throughout the broad Dorsata range in Asia.,Yayasan Riak Bumi,,Heri and his organization; Riak Bumi; have facilitated the development of an innovative honey business in the West Kalimantan forest community; allowing indigenous forest dwellers to use forest resources while preserving natural biodiversity. He seized the potential of a forest honey community business which had already been built up by earlier generations to connect local producers to outside markets. Now; the forest-honey collectors; the majority of whom are young people; have increased their income eight-fold. Riak Bumi helps communities enter competitive markets by developing their harvesting; packaging; and marketing techniques. With this newly developed; flourishing business; impoverished forest dwellers are no longer pressured to earn a living by cutting down trees or exploiting forest resources in an environmentally unfriendly way. Providing for family members takes precedence over protecting forests; people are more likely to respond to initiatives to protect their environment and understand the effects of resource depletion if they can first connect their own survival to the forest. The high economic return has raised concerns from the wider Indonesian population of the need to protect the forests; which are the habitat of Asia's indigenous honey-producing Dorsata bees; from unsustainable resource exploitation. This viable sustainable livelihood is supported by a customary law; an indigenous law or custom that protects native populations' land rights; which states that the rights of local populations must be taken into consideration with the management of natural resources within or surrounding their communities. Along with developing the local economy by selling forest products in other markets; Heri is working with local and central jurisdictions to revitalize this ineffective law to give local populations their legal right to participate in resource management. He has facilitated a relationship between forest communities and legal bodies to enact a policy that limits commercial exploitation of forest areas. The model has successfully reduced forest fires; incidences of cyanide explosive fishing; and other environmentally hazardous practices in the Santarum Park site in West Kalimantan. Heri's work has extended well beyond its beginnings in West Kalimantan. Communities on four different islands are now expanding the marketing success of forest honey. This network of producers is able to connect with national and international organizations; allowing them to build a profile as citizen lobbyists and active participants in the decision making of commercial markets. Heri has partnered with the Non-Timber Forest Products-Exchange Program to replicate this model throughout the broad Dorsata range in Asia.

Muchlis believes that ordinary Indonesians can own a television station and produce programs that reflect their interests. This is reflected in Kendari TV, whose slogan, ""All for All,"" is rooted in the aspiration to make the active audience the protagonist and the subject of TV. This active audience is developed based on Muchlis's insight that public participation and support can be achieved by diversifying programming.",Kendari TV,,"Muchlis is pioneering a movement of community-based television across Indonesia. Kendari TV, established in 2003, by Muchlis is currently attracting 85 per cent of the target audience, while breaking the myth that setting up a television station is too expensive for citizens to do on a limited budget. Ordinary people are now using this powerful media as a tool in their communities where they can own, design, and use their information to develop effective citizenry. Kendari TV is a start up organization that uses the resources available in the community. Muchlis's passion is to start a new pattern in television broadcast, where the driving motive is not profit but for people to be active participants in issues that have an impact on their daily lives. Through active programming, in which more than 50 per cent of the programming is on public dialogue, news and social issues that provides a venue for the citizen to become an active audience, he has been able to create a strong social investment and maintain independence from commercial networks. Kendari TV has therefore been able to sustain its programming for the past six years due to a pattern of strong public ownership that reinforces community participation. Muchlis has used this success as a platform for replicating eight TV stations in four big islands – training other citizen sector organizations to build their own community television networks. An exception is a local government station that buys programming from Kendari TV. To further speed development of community TV, Muchlis established the Indonesia Association of Community TV (ASTEKI), in 2008, along with other civil-society organizations in Kalimantan and Sumatra that had already replicated his Kendari model. Through support of the Free Voice, Kendari TV has also shared its successful model with citizen sector organizations in Asia and Africa.",http://www.kendari.tv,,,,

Her approach includes monitoring during pregnancy that continues through delivery and infancy, bringing together parents, health cadres, traditional birth attendants (TBAs), and village midwives. Her parenting messages help mothers and those interacting with children to craft more stimulating home environments. In 1984, Anna founded the Surya Kanti Foundation: Center for Development of Child Potential (PUSPPA: Pusat Pengembangan Potensi Anak) as a model for early detection and early treatment of child developmental disorders that provides promotive, preventive, curative and habilitative care for children up to five years in age. She focuses on those with special needs, helping kids develop into productive and confident individuals. The Surya Kanti team consists of medical professionals, psychologist, therapists, pedagogue and social workers from a wide range of disciplines, including pediatrics, neurology ophthalmology, rehabilitation ,and ENT specialist. Parents/caretakers are involved as partners in the identification and treatment management of children with developmental delays and disorders. Another of Anna's innovations is the adjustment of the concept of Early Childhood Care and Development (ECCD for Indonesia- Asuhan Dini Tumbuh Kembang Anak (ADITUKA)), building the early detection and treatment effort into a more comprehensive ""women and early childhood care"" movement. Again, this adopts a holistic approach that views children as complete and complex individuals with unique talents and weaknesses. Early learning, early detection and intervention are addressed from pregnancy, delivery, and through the six year of child's life, with parents and the community integrally involved in the process. Anna's comprehensive approach has become common practice in both rural and urban areas in Indonesia, enabling parents, village health cadres, midwives, and pediatricians to monitor early childhood development more closely. Indonesia's Education Ministry, with a loan from the World Bank, then implemented the national adoption of Anna's model for child development monitoring to spread throughout the country.

Her vision is to change the way society values the contributions of domestic workers so that their rights as both workers and citizens are protected. Lita's new educational system-the first of its kind in Indonesia-teaches domestic workers life skills; educates them about their legal rights as workers, women, and citizens, and trains them to negotiate fair, written contracts with their employers. Although Lita provides alternative learning opportunities, she also encourages young domestic workers to seek more formal educational programs. As a result, workers become more competent and more confident, and they have begun to communicate with employers about their rights and responsibilities.   To further raise awareness about the problems faced by domestic workers, Lita is helping those women lead a public campaign. She has established a space in which domestic workers can meet to socialize, share their problems, and seek advice. With Lita's assistance, they have organized the first-ever domestic workers' union to advocate for their legal rights and for better working conditions.   Lita realizes that ensuring those rights requires policies that guarantee legal and institutional support, as well as a shift in attitudes and social relationships. With this approach in mind, she founded and chairs a national support group that (a) conducts research on the conditions of domestic workers, (b) advocates for their rights, (c) mobilizes public support, and (d) develops strategies for drafting and passing legislation. By working at all levels with domestic workers, their employers, the public, and the policymakers, Lita is changing the legal status of domestic workers throughout the country.",https://www.changemakers.com/ashoka-fellows/entries/jala-prt-pekerja-rumah-tangga,,,,

As a key part of her strategy, Farha identifies male and female leaders in religious schools and organizations to help her gain entry to their communities. Some already espouse women's rights within an Islamic perspective, and others learn about these ideas for the first time in Farha's intensive workshops. Together with those influential leaders, Farha has established an active network through her organization, the Center for Education and Information on Islam and Women's Rights (RAHIMA) that brings people with progressive views together to strengthen the cause of equality and to improve women's daily lives.   To confront the negative health consequences of isolation and subjugation of women, Farah's network is establishing crisis and reproductive health centers to provide practical services that reflect a philosophy of respect for women's rights. To support those efforts and answer basic needs, Farha works with secular citizen organizations (COs) and educational institutions to train midwife activists to provide reproductive healthcare in pesantren. In this way, Farha links religious communities to a broader network through a carefully conceived, nonconfrontational approach that provides both egalitarian education from a religious perspective and practical benefits to women's lives.   As conservatism has increased and fundamentalism has come into the mainstream in Indonesia, Farha's work has taken on a new urgency.

To do that, they must begin to heal, both individually and collectively, to recover trust, and to regenerate their community's infrastructure. Samsidar helps women design solutions to problems resulting from years of displacement and erosion of social trust. She begins by bringing together the most vulnerable women—those who live in displacement camps and who have experienced a high rate of domestic violence or sexual assault, often at the hands of police and military authorities. Women recount their experiences to peers, prioritize their values and needs in terms of recovery, and receive help to reach those goals. Samsidar fosters peer-to-peer support groups that help women build temporary houses, secure an education for their children—many of whom have dropped out of school—and begin to recover economically. Samsidar supplements local resources with highly targeted assistance from her colleagues in the citizen sector.

Samsidar knows that it is particularly powerful for women in the camps to receive support from those who have not lost their homes or experienced the same level of devastation. As former neighbors reunite and rediscover what they share in common, the more fortunate neighbors often begin working to document the police and military brutality their sisters have experienced. Samsidar is cultivating ordinary citizen's abilities to become paralegals, as a way to lobby for the rights of women victims in the legal sphere.

Using fashion as an entry point, Dynand turns the consumerism usually associated with it on its head. Participants in Jember Fashion Carnival don't buy costumes, but instead use what they have, thereby transforming simple materials after studying images and ideas from many sources. The year-long process of staging the carnival redefines fashion as an alternative, informal means of educating youth and transforming their lives. Carnival participants learn about important contemporary issues, develop a variety of new skills, and, finally, perform for the public. The carnival's socially oriented themes encourage participants and spectators alike to engage with other parts of Indonesia and the world.   For young people in Jember, where the traditional economy has declined, the future can seem quite limited. Dynand addresses this pessimism by demonstrating that an event as seemingly superficial as a fashion carnival can, in fact, generate widespread change. During its five years of operation, the carnival has reached more than 400 young people, all directly involved in preparing for the event; thousands of locals who come to watch the show; and a variety of community institutions, ranging from small businesses to schools and even mosques, have been involved.  Participants in the carnival become like an extended family, and that spirit soon spreads, thus strengthening ties within the community as a whole. Dynand has won the support of community leaders, including Muslim clerics who initially opposed the carnival. In addition to giving young people a way to be acknowledged by their community, the carnival provides the community with a flourishing tourist attraction. It has stimulated local entrepreneurship and has given rise to new economic activity in Jember.

The first is the exclusion of indigenous peoples from the benefits of education. The second is a paternalism that treats such peoples either as savages that must be civilized, or features of the natural environment that must be preserved. Butet simply wants to make it possible for people to make informed choices about how to cope with change, preserving when they wish, adapting when they see fit, but always enjoying their freedom to choose. She sees that working with young people is the most viable approach to solving these two systemic obstacles to full and equal citizenship.Butet is preparing young indigenous people to help their communities make informed and dignified choices about how they will cope with change. The first step is to provide basic education—literacy and comprehension of the wider world. Since the school system does not extend into remote areas, Butet is creating a national volunteer service to place teachers in remote communities. Based on her own experience teaching in the forests of Sumatra, Butet has developed a completely new method that allows people from pre-literate societies to quickly learn to read and write Indonesian. While Butet believes in the power of education in general, she is also scouting for young people who can begin building bridges between their communities and the many outside interests they now face. Her organization runs a program that brings youth from indigenous communities into national forums discussing natural resource use, forests, and forest communities. Butet has identified 700 communities nationwide that are facing pressure to change yet have no educational opportunities for their young people.

The sustainability of the project depends heavily upon the community ownership of the system. It allows the community to have equity in funding the system, make decisions for its design and operation, and develop the rural programs that will benefit from the generated revenue. All of these endeavors are made possible through the local cooperative mechanism Mumpuni has introduced. Aside from local ownership of the off-grid system, the sustainability of the system is very much influenced by market forces. Most local micro-hydropower operations fold once the state-owned and subsidized electricity company, PLN, enters the market. Mumpuni has been able to connect the community-based off-grid system to PLN's grid. This link is crucial because the community is now able to sell their power supply to the PLN and gain revenue from the deal. This business model has attracted private investment as well. Along with her organization, People Centered Economic &amp; Business Institute (IBEKA), Mumpuni facilitated a local business partner and the community of Cinta Mekar of West Java to pilot a public-private partnership model where both provide equity funding for the system. The provision of rural micro-hydropower (MHP) plants has now become an economic investment activity. The United Nations Economic Commission for Asia and the Pacific (UNESCAP) adopted it as a Public Private Partnership model in the Asia Pacific region. Slowly, the financial barriers to develop the MHP system are being removed. A legal framework, however, must be in place to facilitate the spread of the model.

He achieves this by reaching the people who work with communities and teaching them to undertake simple, but powerful budget analysis in their community outreach efforts. He then follows their progress with an eye for best practices and has begun building a story bank of successes: poor communities securing funds for programs that they really need. Through these stories, and through the growth of his program, Rinto aims to change the budgeting cycle to routinely include input from communities.Several factors make Rinto's idea particularly relevant in Indonesia today. District budgets are now published and available to everyone, a hopeful nod in the direction of transparency. In addition, districts have taken a larger role in collecting fees and taxes from citizens, which means that it is simple to calculate revenue and expense in terms of the taxes people pay and the public services rendered. Moreover, most planning regulations include a clause stating that the process should be ""open"" to the public, though the citizen sector has yet to invent ways to intercede.

He is raising agricultural productivity in Indonesia's driest lands through the combination of sustainable technologies, farmer cooperatives, and the development of new farm products and markets. A drip irrigation specialist and avid inventor, Hamzah is driven by a simple insight into the nature of the problems that face the rural people with whom he works: accessing maximum benefit from the resources already available is a more practical, more sustainable approach than pinning hopes on a large ""project"" like a dam. His life's work is a continual effort to strengthen agriculture through people's ownership and management of appropriate technology.Hamzah's first success was his invention of a simple drip irrigation gadget and, subsequently, its transformation into a powerful development tool. He discovered that local materials, including clay and rice husks, could be processed into crude ceramic knobs that allow water to drip at a regulated pace. Called ""emitters"" in irrigation parlance, these instruments, when attached to discarded water bottles, can be fashioned into an effective drip irrigation system. The result is a locally produced irrigation system that can be manufactured and sold at one-tenth of the cost of comparable systems.But Hamzah understood that simply producing and selling a technology-no matter how ""appropriate"" or inexpensive it might be-would not have the lasting impact, or the geographical reach, required to help people work their way out of poverty. He needed-simultaneously-to develop this product, a primary market of its users, and a secondary market for new farm produce. Crucial to his idea is increasing the scale of social benefit so that dry-land farmers, in addition to earning more cash in the present, can over the long term recover the productive capacity of their land.Having spent a number of years developing the drip irrigation system, Hamzah is now marketing it, spreading its impact, and using its success to establish a movement to support other technical and social programs for dry areas. With the proven success of the emitter, Hamzah has also begun to develop other technologies for dry-land communities.

But the banjar's most important role is as a training ground for the new generation of local leaders who will be instrumental in shaping Indonesia's emerging democracy. The present gap in leadership-one legacy of an authoritarian history-can be filled either by well-trained leaders with good intentions or by party operatives and opportunists; banjar is one institutional mechanism that can help people prefer the former. When villagers are asked to elect their representatives, those representatives who have served villagers well on the banjar can stand as candidates. But regardless of who ends up on the councils, Yamin sees the new banjar as an important vehicle for monitoring councils and ensuring their transparency.

By building a youth movement that brings marital practices, a subject not usually discussed openly, into public discussion, Zubie is working on two fronts. She creates an unprecedented opportunity for adolescents to reflect on family matters at a pivotal point in their lives, when they will either repeat the behavior they have seen or break from it.

While growing up in a neighborhood of petty traders, Kasmiati observed firsthand the injustices directed toward her mother and other women in the village, and also their endless struggle to pull themselves out of the cycle of poverty. Traditionally, the women had no money and thus no bargaining power. Kasmiati saw the need to establish a group of women working together who could provide one another with emotional support, and who could also form an alliance that would bolster their bargaining power when entering into economic enterprises outside the home.Kasmiati envisions an independent women's cooperative that would, unlike most traditional cooperatives, require active membership as well as work on economic development.Kasmiati's approach is to develop each member as a whole person, not just to develop an income generation scheme. The organization which Kasmiati founded, the Anissa Cooperative, emphasizes a social agenda in addition to its income generation component. By addressing needs for education, health and welfare, legal rights, and leadership development, the 800 Sasak women members are growing bolder. They are beginning to take a more active role in decisionmaking within the household, as well as publicly pursuing their rights in the broader community. This process of building social and economic empowerment is long and painstaking, but, once under way, it is all but irreversible.Anissa's economic impact is also proving powerful. Its small low-interest loans are financing a growing number of investments in new producing and trading activities that allow members to improve (often double) their incomes. As the Sasak women find their own voice and increase their economic base, they are moving closer to their own emancipation.As Kasmiati has developed Anissa from its tiny beginning in her own neighborhood, she has increasingly turned her attention to how to achieve a far wider impact. Anissa will grow, helping others learn from its experiences. However, Kasmiati has launched a more aggressive strategy as well.She began this new dimension of her work by bringing together all the groups concerned in any way with women on her home island, Lombok (it lies just east of Bali).

Historically, social initiatives such as family planning campaigns have successfully used traditional storytelling, which is not only entertaining, but stimulates creativity and teaches about morals and local knowledge. Kak WeEs has allied himself with an established network of neighborhood leaders who use his storytelling techniques to communicate with local residents and promote his approach to family communication. Within the formal education system, he has set up a pilot school project where he trains educators to integrate storytelling techniques into each individual subject in the curriculum.

However, charity does not help the poor to break out of poverty and therefore leaves incomes unequal and the village poor, despite the presence of some prosperous families.How to give life to zakat giving? Muslich's answer is, in effect, to make both donor and recipient responsible actors in the community's development. He engages the donors, to the degree they are willing, in selecting the poorest families, and in working out sound investment strategy for each of these families.

He also encourages them to work with the donors, not in the old patron-client frame but as partners in a development process that benefits both.

His model of integrated education, where children of various ethnic heritages learn together, is beginning to reduce the deep-seated discrimination that divides Indonesian society.",Yayasan Sultan Iskandar Muda,,"Ethnic conflict has become so commonplace that mere mention of it conjures up images of places all over the globe: Bosnia and Serbia, Kashmir, Rwanda, Sri Lanka, among others. Indonesia belongs on the list as well. Typically, Indonesian children of Chinese descent and those with indigenous backgrounds are raised and taught in separate communities, although they may live in close proximity to one another. Without the chance to interact, negative stereotypes and mistrust of each other lead to hostility and prejudice-- traits which, when encountered in adults, are very difficult to reverse. While most of the world addresses the results of ethnic tension-- violence and discrimination, Dr. Sofyan Tan is reaching the root of the problem by creating opportunities for children to learn in a different kind of setting.Realizing the havoc that ethnic divisiveness in Indonesia has wreaked on individual lives and the country as a whole, Sofyan is setting up integrated schools with an even mixture of Chinese and indigenous (Malay) students. He is not the first to establish integrated schools but no other school can boast of such an even ethnic balance in the student body. These schools allow children to see each other as individuals, thereby setting a new pattern of openness and friendliness toward people of different ethnicities that will carry into adulthood and the larger society.However, Sofyan contends that maintaining ethnic integration is insignificant without two complementary features: academic quality and access for those in financial need. Because integrated schools will earn credibility only if they provide a top notch education, Sofyan started an institute in 1988 in Medan, North Sumatra, to assist the government in extending and improving the quality of education. Parents who are skeptical of integrated schools are likely to be persuaded by their academic reputation. As a case in point, when Sofyan's first school started in 1987, only 162 students enrolled but as the reputation spread, enrollment reached 1,362 in 1997. Students now travel great distances to attend the school; some even travel from Jakarta.Central to Sofyan's idea is that integrated schools must be an accessible and attractive option to people of all backgrounds, particularly poor uneducated Indonesians of Chinese descent. Some members of this population feel safer in the insular cocoon of their Chinese community, where they speak Hokkien instead of Indonesian. Sofyan explains, ""People whose education is higher are more inclined to embrace integration, while people from lower classes find it more difficult."" The exorbitant tuition fees of other integrated schools have always provided a good excuse for poor ethnic Chinese not to enroll.

The legal concept of land ownership is redefined and new mechanisms for recording transfers and establishing ownership introduced. The newcomers understand, since the new system they are importing is theirs. But, unaware that there are new rules, let alone how to use them, the indigenous people do not use them and lose out. The newcomers, equally ignorant of traditional land laws and therefore rights, take possession without embarrassment and then, especially once subsequent purchases and sales have taken place, look to the law and the state's power to defend what is ""theirs.""Zadrak wants to short-circuit this predictably unfair and deeply divisive process by helping both sides understand that there are two overlapping and conflicting sets of laws at work. He also seeks to help the Irianese community's leaders learn how to use the two systems both to protect their people's interests vis-a-vis the non-Irianese immigrants to the island and to negotiate conflicts between Irianese clans that otherwise tend to build up into violence.First, he is analyzing and codifying the traditional laws of the clans governing land tenure and use. A 1960 Indonesian law, the Land Regulation Act Number Five, gives significant recognition to such customary laws. By making them easily accessible in writing, he will provide new grounds that local people can use to defend their interests and a tool that judges and administrators can use as well.Second, he will work with the clans to define disputed borders between them, thus helping them to unite rather than fight. Finally, he will offer a series of training courses and follow-on backup for Irianese community and religious leaders that will enable them to know and fight effectively for their constituents' rights.

Many of its individual components have been tried before with varying degrees of success. However, Hyronimus is making them all work, and work together. His approach emphasizes prevention rather than cure, disseminates knowledge of basic health care techniques, and reduces the demand for emergency care while making it more accessible.Hyronimus has built 164 local community health groups, or ""clusters"" on the island of Lembata (total population 96,000). These clusters, in which young mothers play a particularly important role, take charge of community health and child care. His clusters also provide a forum within which members can explore related issues, and the organization and resources to see related initiatives through. Some clusters have taken advantage of this to build and maintain family latrines, while others have begun to raise pigs and ducks for use as inexpensive supplementary sources of protein that do not require much land.This decentralized, self-help approach to health care serves several important purposes. Self-help care, at least for the foreseeable future, is practically the only way health care can reach more than a token minority of rural families. Perhaps even more important in the long run, the clusters empower their members, chiefly young women, by directly giving them the ability and responsibility to take charge of their own destiny.",https://www.changemakers.com/ashoka-fellows/entries/individual-indonesia-4,,,,
147,147,147,Sri Wahyaningsih,Indonesia,"Wahya, working in the small village of Lawen in central Java, is demonstrating approaches to education that help rural youngsters feel rooted in, not alienated from their community and its economics.",SALAM,,"Distressed by seeing so many schoolchildren learning little, having no fun, and becoming alienated from their surroundings, Wahya has developed an alternative approach to education that demonstrably does far better on all three accounts. She has applied it to preschool and, for older children up to eighteen, in an after-school program that typically begins at 3:00 p.m. After initial hostility from the government schoolteachers, her approaches are beginning to gain acceptance. Visible educational success, community support, and her tact explain and demonstrate the program's impact as well as suggest the broader potential of her ideas.Her approach is participative and democratic for both teachers and students. It weaves together basic reading, current events, language skills, and some science along with dance, music, and drama. All of these studies are then brought to life, in the students' daily chores and in the real achievements and problems of the community.The teachers, all volunteers, meet weekly to design the next week's curriculum. The students also make suggestions. Not only do they block out what they are going to cover, but they look for local experiences or problems that will help in the learning process. For example, when they chose to study plant disease, they went to a sick field and investigated. (They discovered that bad seeds were the cause, which in turn invited a discussion of how this happened and of the possible remedies available to the affected farmer.)The youngsters learn to help one another with their school assignments, in the group's artistic productions, and in getting their chores done. Projects such as rabbit raising are also done together, with profits going half in dividends to the participating students and half into savings accounts for them. Thus learning to collaborate is not only a valuable work skill traditionally greatly valued by Javanese society, but is very much part of Wahya's strategy of building a strong, warm sense of community-- one of the most powerful antidotes to the alienating pull of the formal schools and the urban-based media.By incorporating chores into the curriculum, Wahya has found an important key to winning the parents' support for her work, and to avoiding their opposition. By then adding new and successful income-generating programs for these parents' youngsters, she has further solidified parents' support for her program.In the course of doing so, she has developed a new funding mechanism that could eventually prove to be of wide-ranging value well beyond the immediate application for which she developed it. She has, in effect, found a successful way to connect middle-class urban savers with rural borrowers that allows the former very high yields and the latter medium-term loans that would be prohibitive at the rates charged by local money lenders.Some of her urban friends, whom she met as a student in Yogyakarta, lend enough for a village youth to buy a calf for 400,000 rupiah (roughly $140). The youth then raises the calf to maturity in six to twelve months, benefiting from it in the meantime, and then sells it for 600,000 rupiah. Half the profit goes to the lender, providing a return in nine months of over thirty percent. The student gets both his or her equal profit share and another successful learning experience likely to encourage interest in the local economy.Even after just a few years' work, Wahya's youngsters stand out as especially articulate and confident, and Lawen has begun winning one government competition after another.",https://www.changemakers.com/ashoka-fellows/entries/salam,,,,

Another factor, according to her, is the lack of a labor union that is led, managed, and handled by workers - a union that can voice the needs and interests of laborers.Ari is developing an education program to inform laborers about their rights and about strategies to take when dealing with work disputes; simultaneously, she is raising their awareness about their significant role in industry and preparing them to be true labor leaders.

Governed until recently by somnolent local custom and largely ignored by others, this coastal region is suddenly experiencing a series of profound changes, many beyond the grasp not only of the local people and rule but also of the newer institutions springing up to help.Iwan is setting up something between a framework and an association to bring together and help all the widely differing groups working to help fishermen and their coastal neighbors across Eastern Indonesia, especially East and West Nusa Tenggara, Maluku, and Irian. It is designed to reinforce local organizations, community groups, or producers and their associations.First, Iwan wants to strengthen the smaller, more local groups. Second, it seeks to provide services and allow effective action on the regional and national levels that are beyond the reach of their local constituents, but that are now essential as larger forces come to bear on the region. More especially, he wants to encourage the private voluntary organizations (PVO's) to do what they do best, to innovate. To do so they must break free of the conformist thinking he feels increasingly characterizes the emerging PVO sector in Indonesia. That, in turn, means that the institution he builds must be carefully structured not to become a vehicle that encourages common thinking but instead truly strengthens and respects local innovators.Second, he'll provide a framework where those working in the many different organizations in the field will be able to obtain, and contribute to, common services. Training and mutual help consultancy are two examples. His association will organize training sessions, very much expecting the participants to share their expertise as well as learn. This service then flows naturally on into groups that have mastered a needed skill e.g., how to build and place artificial reef-like structures to inexpensively attract fish, help those elsewhere in the region master it.By functioning on a broader plain, moreover, his organization will be able to give its constituents longer reach. He envisages, for example, helping these small, geographically remote organizations reach out more effectively to funders. This will also facilitate their having an impact on national and regional policies, suddenly quite essential. Iwan's organization can help collect information, identify risks and opportunities, and concert parallel or collective initiative.Iwan has a number of specific ideas he plans to pursue while building this new institution. One example illustrates his sense of the importance of reaching out beyond the PVO community's collective thinking. Because PVO's commonly see the ""patrons"" or owners of fishing boats as businessmen and even explorers rather than the poor these organizations seek to serve, they generally don't work with them. However, Iwan believes that helping them be more efficient offers major opportunities and that working through the patrons may be one of the most effective ways to stop harmful practices (such as bombing the coral reefs with dynamite to drive more fish into the nets).",https://www.changemakers.com/ashoka-fellows/entries/individual-indonesia-3,,,,

First, there must be a physical demonstration center that serves as the heart of each region's environmental education work. People have to experience the environment either to appreciate it or to understand its complex workings. Theoretical discussions and paper displays are especially unhelpful in this uniquely interconnected, subtle field. Second, to be effective in this field, a popular educator must be highly motivated, broadly interested, and creative. The number of issues and the diversity of people to be served requires this. Government servants only very rarely have the drive to reach beyond their categories or to create effective ways and expend the energy required truly to reach the public. Suryo some years ago set out to build a model environmental education program that meets these two criteria. For years his colleagues and supervisors told him he was dreaming, that centers such as he was imagining would be financially unsustainable white elephants. Nonetheless, he persisted. Somehow he amassed the support necessary launch the first such center at Trawas in his native East Java. Located on a wooded 3.7-hectare site, it includes a library, training rooms, a dormitory and bungalows, a greenhouse, a model of a paddy field, demonstrations of alternative and organic agriculture, a segment of a tropical rainforest, and a number of trails. Through this complex, Suryo provides educational programs that are down to earth, experimental, very concrete, easy to understand - and, therefore, popular. He organizes trainees into small groups of five or so to facilitate discussion and hands-on experimenting. Thus, for example, visitors not only hear of the idea of producing cooking charcoal from garbage, but they also produce and use it themselves.

This success, however, is limited by the fact that most children, especially those from poor families, drop out during the first three or four years.",Individual Indonesia,,"Ummu Salamah's dream is to see these children continue on. Realizing that her children compelled her to learn and change her perspectives as no one else could, Ummu is developing an approach that begins by helping one child in each poor family to be excited by and successful in school. She believes that seeing the resulting successes firsthand, more than anything else, can trigger a process that will push the family free of the vicious cycle of poverty. Ummu is launching her model with children from 700 of the poorest families in a depressed rural area near Garut, West Java. Ummu and her team are organizing preschool playgroups (the poor cannot afford to pay for kindergarten); creating study groups, each of eight to ten, for children who are having trouble in school; providing activities ranging from traditional arts to scouting (elsewhere government-run); and offering direct health services and nutritional help. On each step of the way, Ummu tries to help the children understand what they are doing and why it is important. She keeps their parents very much in mind as a secondary audience. As her work with the children opens the door to their families, Ummu follows up closely. She helps crystalize and extend their growing understanding and changing expectations of what is right for their children. Further, as they decide that they want to do more, e.g. letting their children stay in school rather than help the family with work, she brings the second half of her program to bear. Such new ambitions for the families of these children are expensive. Ummu therefore helps the families increase their incomes, taking advantage of their strengthened motivation and seeking to prevent their economic failure. She does so through an ambitious mix of approaches, some drawing on existing programs, others innovative adaptations. (For example, she is helping some of the parents produce thread from low-grade wool that had previously been thrown away.) In other words, Ummu hopes that the spark that begins with one child will spread to others and then ignite a family-wide growth process.",https://www.changemakers.com/ashoka-fellows/entries/individual-indonesia-1,,,,
