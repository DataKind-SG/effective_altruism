“Self Empowerment & Educational Development Society” (SEEDS) saw light with the approval from Registry of Societies Malaysia to begin its mission to fulfil its vision and objectives on 8th September 2016.
The formation of the Self Empowerment & Educational Development Society (SEEDS) is based on the principles of its founder, Jeevithan P Ganasan, a well-known socialist/activist in Malaysia. . He has been known for the many social activities and his fight for justice. Having contributed much, this platform serves to continue the works of MCEO (which had to be deregistered due to some issues caused by irresponsible parties) to benefit the community in more ways than one. A motto of Jeevithan always lived by, ‘Teach one to fish instead of giving the fish’ and he believes in empowering and educating individuals instead of spoon feeding them. SEEDS aims to achieve this by providing a platform for the community to grow, learn and develop themselves. It believes that only through this, will the less fortunate escape the poverty trap; that has so many of our community struggling to get out of. It also follows suit in its founder’s ethics to walk the talk and not just make promises without the means to see it through. It further aims to make a realistic difference in the community; further promising to ensure it is done. With holistic plans to instil confidence and build capabilities, SEEDS intends to uplift marginalised communities to greater heights. By doing so, the organisation hopes to develop competent Malaysians who will be capable of standing on their own feet and have the mind-set to excel instead of depending on charitable hand-outs or the goodwill of others to survive.
It is also a society created to empower people in entrepreneurship and strengthen the community by enlightening them on the importance of education; and also a new platform for the Malaysian Community Development Organisation (MCEO).

YSPM was originally mooted in late 2013 at a meeting of leaders of Parent-Teacher Associations (PTAs) of schools in Putrajaya. They were desirous of setting up a foundation to carry out activities to complement the efforts of the government of Malaysia to further lift the standard of education in Malaysia as outlined in the Plan Pembangunan Pendidikan Malaysia 2013-2025 (PPPM 2013-2025). In particular, while the PPPM 2013-25 is very comprehensive, there are always areas where non-governmental organisations can play meaningful synergistic roles. One of these areas lies in the contributions of PTAs of schools.
PTAs that are active can offer good support to schools, enabling the school’s management to conduct various initiatives over and above what the government can provide. These initiatives will obviously benefit the students, giving them a better chance at academics, as well as, all-rounded excellence.
However, the abilities of PTAs to offer the much needed support to the schools differ widely due to a multitude of reasons. Schools in the rural areas, in the interior, as well as urban poor schools face greater challenges compared to urban schools. These challenges include poor leadership, lack of support from parents of students, low financial resources and poor basic infrastructure. It is therefore not surprising that in terms of performance, annual statistics continue to show urban students performed better compared to those in the rural areas, in the interiors and in urban poor schools.
The government of Malaysia is aware of this gap in performance. In fact, this gap is listed as a priority item in the (PPPM 2013-2025) and many initiatives and action plans in this document are aimed at bridging this gap.YSPM wishes to complement the efforts of the government to bridge this gap in overall performance between urban students and students in the rural areas, in the interiors and in urban poor schools.
 YSPM intends to do this by offering support and assistance to PTAs of schools, especially schools in the rural areas, in the interiors and urban poor schools. This, in essence, is what YSPM is all about.
 In order to accomplish this, funds are needed. YSPM is grateful to the government of Malaysia for providing the initial grant to set up this foundation but its continuous existence will require funding assistance from corporations or individuals. In this respect, YSPM is unique as it is an officially recognised platform through which contributions can be made to benefit PTAs of schools in Malaysia.
 YSPM was officially incorporated on 03 November 2014 as a company limited by guarantee and not having a share capital. Its patron is the Minister of Education of Malaysia.
 We hope you share our vision and we invite you to be part of this noble effort to nurture and develop our young. The future begins here, let’s bridge this gap!",enquiry@yspm.org.my ,Yayasan Sarana Pendidikan Malaysia,http://www.yspm.org.my,,

Raleigh is not just about an expedition; it’s about being part of a community of like-minded people. Ordinary people who want to do something extraordinary with their lives, make a difference in the world and new friends along the way. Raleigh’s vision is to inspire a generation to be all that they can be; to awaken a sense of life-purpose and belonging, and unite them as part of a global community who can work together to rise to the challenges of the world we live in.

The groundwork for today’s solid base began in 1982. The Heart Foundation of Malaysia was established by a small group of dedicated and concerned lay people who were determined to make an impact on the control of heart and blood vessel disease.
In the 1960’s, deaths in Malaysia were due to communicable diseases such as tuberculosis, malaria, typhoid and cholera. Our health system was then developing and our health facilities were inadequate to meet the needs and demands of the population.
With the improved standard of living and better understanding, now, there is a control of these diseases. However, more than 20 years later, heart disease death rates and stroke deaths have increased and has become the No. 1 killer. More people are being affected by heart and blood vessel diseases.
We believe we can share in the effort to prevent and control the situation. Educating the public by bringing awareness has resulted in encouraging response from the society. Heart and blood vessel disease is our major killer, claiming almost twice as many lives as cancer and accounting for a high percentage of all certified deaths each year. In 1995, 28.2 % of all medically reported deaths in Malaysia were attributed to CVD (cardiovascular diseases). By international standards, this figure does cause a concern for Malaysia.
The Heart Foundation of Malaysia is a non-profit and non-governmental organisation dedicated to the education of the public on heart and circulatory diseases. We are funded almost entirely by public support from our well-meaning society. In addition, we receive some limited government co-operation for specific projects. The Foundation’s heart-health message is direct and effective – enjoy healthy eating, exercise, be smoke-free and check your blood pressure regularly.

Fur Kids Farm (FKF) began with one puppy called Ruff. He was beaten up and was in a very bad condition. He was neglected by a neighbour. One day he wandered away and luckily showed up at our gate. We stood up against the neighbour, kept him & nursed him to health. Today Ruff is a healthy boy and his loyalty & dedication to us is beyond words.
Ruff’s past suffering made us want to reach out to other animals that are ill-treated and are in danger. So, we started rescuing animals. In the span of two years, to date, we’ve rescued about 200 animals that have been abused or injured. FKF has chosen to focus specifically in rescue, rehabilitation and re-homing of abused or injured animals as we feel personally called upon to stop cruelty towards animals.
The past two years, we’ve been a self-funded movement. We converted our home into a sanctuary and shared it with the animals we saved. We have a team that gave up their respective careers to dedicate themselves to this cause.At the end of 2014, we chose to go public regarding our work and also register as a non-profit charity in order to allow us to reach more animal in need as well as to spread word on the fight against cruelty towards animals.
Our facilities
FKF is currently located at our own home. As such our presence is not accepted by all our neighbours and we’ve had incidents of neighbours beating, trying to poison and other abusive actions such as dousing our animals with hot water. Our location also does not meet local city council regulations. For all these reason it is critical that FKF move to a location that is safer for our animals.
Our center is not equipped with any facilities. We build temporary cages as we need them to house the animals. The reason for this is space constraints as well as financial strain. We are in talks with UPM Vet to obtain discounts for treatments. However we still need sponsors for pet food.
Our major financial strain is the medical cost of our animals as well as providing them food.
We are also looking to move to a new location in Kuala Kubu Bharu to a land donated to us for shelter use. However, the land is in a valley which requires land clearing and building of a shelter, both of which we need sponsor for. We are also in talks with the Selangor State Government to try obtain a flat piece of land in a more accessible location. This will reduce our land clearing cost as well as make the centre available to local communities.
We are also trying to allow the centre to generate income to fund itself. The plan is to set up an online shop selling pet food and other related items. Towards this end, we are still looking for suppliers and delivery companies who can partner with us.

17,,Advocacy/Animal Welfare/Environment/Youth,,,"Who are we
MESYM.com is run by a group of volunteers who are strongly passionate about environmental issues, and who see great potential in providing a central, online platform for the Malaysian environmental scene. We gather in solidarity and goodwill, with the common aim of making the world a better place.
We aim to streamline the environmental movement in Malaysia, through these interconnected functions:
What do we mean by connecting the green dots? What, or who, are the green dots? There are a few ways of looking at this.
There are many environmentalists or environmentally conscious people trying to do the right thing, and to champion the right causes. However, many of these efforts are scattered and do not get the visibility that they deserve. By connecting them together, we actually see the collective effort, whether for purposes of networking, sharing resources, or just for solidarity. Also, on one hand, organizations working on environmental issues complain of being understaffed and overworked; and on the other hand, people who want to help do not know how to start. We aim to bridge the gap and rectify this problem.
The environmental scene is composed of different sectors of stakeholders. Government departments and policymakers, NGOs and social enterprises, the private sector with their green technology… they need to talk to each other, and work together. This is a platform that cuts across different sectors and shows what everyone is doing.
Within the environmental community, we have different interest groups – the organic movement, the activists on specific crises, the conservationists, to name a few. There is significant overlap in their goals, and potential collaborations can happen. And then there are different communities in different localities – the urban, the rural; the local, the regional, and the international. As environmental crises become more and more frequent and widespread, it is increasingly apparent that all of us are susceptible to issues like climate change, mass extinction of animal species, industrial pollution, and so on. Beyond the environmental community, we try to reach out to other communities such as the arts, the civil rights groups, students… to alert and engage a larger segment of the population.
Issues of environmentalism and sustainability cut across multiple disciplines, and the problems are often bigger than what we can understand. This is why we invite thinkers, academics, journalists, scientists, activists… people who are on the ground, to write for us, and to link these ideas together for us to see a clearer, bigger picture.
So, how do we connect the dots? For the time being, we have two projects:
We provide a central space for people to publish their profiles, events, actions, articles and announcements. Anyone can sign up and use the system to publicize their good actions, or ideas. The platform is free to use, and we market it to three populations: the people who are out there doing good actions, the people who want to start something, and those who are potentially interested to join in.
We organize a monthly get-together where like-minded people can come hang out and get to know each other, over a thought-provoking movie. The event is free to attend. We want to get people to network face-to-face, and generate conversations from the featured documentaries. During the Documentary Night, we also have a 15-minute slot for whoever who wants to talk about their organization, event or action.
Similar to our Monthly Documentary Night, but we screen films featuring “Crossover” topics: Economics, politics, capitalism, democracy, mass media, etc… all these topics (and many more) are directly or indirectly linked with the natural world that we live in. However, these interconnections are not always apparent. With the Crossover Series we show a documentary of a chosen topic in every event, and discuss its connection with environmental issues. Click here for more info in our Crossover Documentary Series.",info@mesym.com,MESYM,http://www.mesym.com/en,,

Simply put, we advocate respect for all living things. So many of us do not see how we’ve contributed to the imbalance between our needs and that of other species – as well as the environment.
Pawsome wants to change that.

Love cats? Please join the nonprofit Cat Lovers International! Dedicated to improving the welfare of cats in communities across the globe, we believe in ‘think globally, act locally.’ Our first major project is the establishment of Cat Beach Sanctuary in the fishing village of Teluk Bahang on the island of Penang, Malaysia where more than 100 cats rescued from desperate situations find loving care.
Future projects planned include publications and educational programs, internships for veterinary students and trainings for those who wish to learn more about cat care, and arts projects celebrating ‘all things cat.’ Also in the works are a “Cat Cafe” and charity store projects to help support the Cat Beach cats.
Please ‘like’ our Facebook Page to learn more about how you can connect with other cat lovers, learn more about cat care – or just enjoy sharing the antics of our furry friends!
And yes, we’re a little bit different from other cat caring orgs — we also want to create a worldwide network of support for the PEOPLE who love cats.
Many ‘hometown heroes’ are out there feeding colonies of ferals, many volunteers give long hours to shelters, clinics, and cat caring organizations. Cat owners  find strays and take them home to foster; some even parent 20 or more cats — and find they are running a cat sanctuary!
And that’s what’s happened in Penang, Malaysia where we are hoping you will help us support our first major project:- the Cat Beach Sanctuary.",catlovers.my@gmail.com,Cat Lovers International / Cat Beach Sanctuary,http://catbeachpenang.com,,

SOS Rhino is a non-profit, international foundation dedicated to preserving the five rhinoceros species in their natural habitats. Our conservation programs combine research, education, marketing and advocacy, all working collectively to achieve sustainable results.
Through diverse stakeholder support, SOS Rhino develops and funds rhino conservation and awareness programs appropriate to individual countries, providing these countries with the knowledge and tools to build lasting rhino conservation.
It is our goal to secure a place for this ancient animal in tomorrow’s world.
Our approach
Our broad approach to conservation evolved from over 20 years of experience supporting and creating various rhino conservation programmes. These programmes include technical assistance and training, the funding of research on medical, nutritional and reproductive problems, building of cage-restraint systems, consulting on care and management of rhinos in captivity and the wild, as well as creating multimedia presentations for education and awareness. We apply this diverse range of expertise to our primary focus, field-based operations.
Our field programmes apply methods that directly build on the capacity of countries to conserve by raising local awareness and assisting protection of habitat and animals. We employ and train local personnel who understand the situation, and can effectively respond to the issues. We garner support from many sectors including local government, business, academic and cultural interests to create a sustainable conservation programme in countries with rhinos. The organisation’s administrative costs are endowed allowing 100% of contributions donated to directly support targeted programmes.
When work began with the rhinos, minimal reproductive information was available. Dr. Schaffer, founder and president of SOS Rhino, along with researchers associated with the organization, furthered the understanding of reproduction of four out of the five species of rhinoceros. Our technical expertise led to the first captive bred born Sumatran rhino birth in 112 years at the Cincinnati Zoo in September 2001.
Our programmes
One of our major programmes is helping to save the last population of rhinos on the island of Borneo, the most endangered of the species, the Sumatran rhino. Because of the ongoing threat of shrinking natural habitats and constant pressure from poaching, the population continues to be in jeopardy. We immediately responded to the request of the Malaysian government’s Sabah Wildlife Department to assist their Rhino Protection Units (RPU) and evaluate the fertility potential within their captive animals. We are fostering support from villages and plantation owners surrounding the rhino reserve by instituting ecotourism. We are alerting the public to this rhino’s crisis through national and international educational programmes and events such as sports challenges, exhibits and televised public service announcements. We established a local affiliate non-profit that is generating local support and understanding. With estimates of fewer than 300 Sumatran rhinos remaining, immediate action on this rhino is critical.
SOS Rhino research programmes have been funded by the MacArthur Foundation, the Institute of Museum Services, the Milwaukee County Zoo and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife. Our researchers are consultants for zoos, institutions and governments in the United States and around the world, including such countries as Malaysia, Indonesia, Nepal, India, and Australia.
Our partners
SOS Rhino is affiliated with numerous professional organisations such as Taxonomic Advisory Group for Rhinos (TAG), Asian Rhino Specialist Group (AsRSG), American Association of Zoo Veterinarians (AAZV), Conservation Breeding Specialist Group (CBSG) of the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) and the World Wildlife Fund (WWF).

The aim of the SPCA is to protect defenceless animals and to alleviate their suffering. SPCA provides temporary shelter to unwanted animals in Selangor and the Federal Territory. These include mainly cats, dogs, rabbits, hamsters, guinea pigs, usually pets that are no longer desired by their owners. From here, we try to re-home as many as possible but with more than 1,100 animals arriving every month (reaching some 13,000 annually), the shelter is constantly challenged by a shortage of space and limited funds.
Our services

1. Adoption programme – Members of the public are encouraged to adopt animals from the SPCA. The adoption fee includes de-worming, vaccination and compulsory neutering (sterilisation). All potential adopters are interviewed and advised, and should be agreeable to home visits by SPCA staff. The shelter is open to visitors everyday, 9am to 4pm.
2. Collection of animals – THE SPCA operates two ambulances which collect unwanted pets and confined strays, by appointment only. The SPCA does not have the manpower to chase/catch free-running strays. If transport is needed, please call SPCA at numbers given below during office hours to have arrangements made as soon as possible.
3. Stray animals in distress – Whilst the animal shelter will receive sick, injured or very young, orphaned animals round-the-clock, the SPCA ambulance can respond to distress calls only between 8am – 8pm. Pet owners with emergencies should consult their own veterinarians; the SPCA is able to advise on where their nearest available vet is located.
4. Inspection of cruelty complaints – SPCA inspectors investigate complaints relating to animal cruelty whenever possible. The identity of complainants is kept confidential; anonymous callers will not be entertained.
5. Educational talks – Upon request, talks are conducted either on SPCA premises or at schools, clubs and other organizations to discuss topics such as responsible ownership, animal care, strays, neutering etc.

RSPCA was founded in Penang in 1948. It is the oldest animal welfare organization in the country. In 1980, RSPCA became SPCA PENANG as its status changed from a branch of RSPCA(UK) to that of an affiliate.
SPCA is a tax exempted charitable organisation. It is run by an elected committee with a mandate for 1 year, renewable at its yearly annual general meetings. It is the only animal welfare Non Governmental Organisation in the State. It runs almost entirely on public donations (tax exempt).
The SPCA Penang plays an important role in the prevention of cruelty and in promoting kindness to animals.
The premise is used as the administrative centre, an animal pound and a veterinary clinic. It runs three vehicles which doubles up as an animal ambulance as well as collecting stray animals which are diseased, injured and in distress. Reports of cruelty cases are investigated by the SPCA’s inspectors who can only advise pet owners on humane treatment of their pets.

The society also covers public eating places as well as from homes especially the housing estates(provided the animal is confined) and whenever called upon by the public. Strays are the responsibility of the 2 local councils in the state of Penang.
2. The SPCA in Penang provides 24 hour ambulance service for sick , diseased and injured animals which are rescued either for humane destruction or convey to veterinarians for treatment. After office hours, only real emergencies will be attended to.
3. It collects unwanted animals by request
4. maintains a pound with 30 kennels and a large cattery as a temporary shelter for unwanted animals and adoptable strays (vaccinated and neutered ). The intake of animals far exceeds the numbers that can be re-homed.

To shelter and care for unwanted, abandoned, injured and stray cats and dogs.
We need volunteers

PAWS has a few full time staff but relies heavily on regular volunteers to provide extra attention to animals, to show visitors around and assist those wishing to adopt a pet.
Our needs
Funding: PAWS does not receive any government funding, relying completely on donations of food / money / other items and adoption fees to support its operations. Running expenses are RM15,000 to RM17,000 per month. Extra improvement projects involve additional cost and sponsors large and small are most welcome. PAWS is a registered organisation and all donations are tax deductible.
PAWS accepts animals surrendered by members of the public, mostly unwanted pets or neighbourhood strays. The Council dog-catchers also bring in many dogs and cats from the MPPJ (Petaling Jaya) and MBSA (Shah Alam) areas. The PAWS animal population averages 350 cats, kittens, dogs and puppies that undergo health programmes and are prepared for hopeful adoption. Sadly with so many Malaysian dogs and cats un-neutered and left to reproduce and have unplanned or unwanted litters, the numbers of unwanted animals far exceed the number of adoptions.
As such PAWS has prepared the following policy statement:
As much as PAWS would wish otherwise, PAWS cannot guarantee that all surrendered animals can be kept or put up for adoption. This is sadly unavoidable for so long as surrenders outnumber adoptions. In a shelter environment it is inevitable that space, staff and financial constraints determine how many animals PAWS can house at any one time. If you surrender an animal to PAWS, you do so with the understanding that the animal may be put to sleep. If this is not acceptable please do not surrender any animal to PAWS. Help PAWS by neutering your pet.
Our services
Dogs, pups, cats and kittens are available for adoption to caring, responsible members of the public. All animals have undergone PAWS Health Screening and Programmes. All have been vaccinated and treated against parasites. Also, to ensure no PAWS animal contributes to the overpopulation of unwanted animals, all adult cats and dogs and all puppies have been neutered before they leave the shelter. Some kittens, if adopted when young, will need to be neutered by their owners later.
1. Animal Shelter – PAWS will accept unwanted animals dropped off at the shelter. All surrenders are subject to acceptance of the policy statement above. You will be asked to give a small donation towards the costs of PAWS caring for the animals.
2. Animal Rescue – PAWS will respond to emergency calls during office hours for areas around Subang, PJ and Shah. Please ensure the animal has been leashed or contained before calling our team as they cannot chase around the neighbourhood. Strays are often very quick to run and hide. Injured animals at the roadside can also be rescued.
3. Animal Pickup – PAWS will pick up unwanted pets in areas around Subang, PJ and Shah Alam. PAWS requests a donation of RM70 for this service.
Our needs
Estimated Monthly Expenditure:     RM35,000
Donations can be made directly via CIMBClicks, PAWS website and other details are available via their Facebook account.
We need:
Medical staff (doctors, nurses, therapists), Accountants or office managers, Volunteer vets, administrative clerk preferably full-time or able to work 36 hours per week
Please call PAWS and ask to speak with our volunteer coordinator if you would like to come and see if this is for you. You may also make contact by email at pawsfeedback@gmail.com
If groups wish to visit, please call first to arrange a time so we can organise a volunteer to show you around.

Non-cash donations:

Information on strays
Stray dogs or cats in the Klang Valley may be taken by members of the public to either SPCA in Ampang Jaya (+03-4256 5312) or to the PAWS shelter in Subang (+03-7846 1087). Stray or lost dogs picked up on the streets by council dog catchers will be taken to the relevant council pounds (see below). Only those found wandering in PJ and Shah Alam areas will later be brought to PAWS.
Council animal pounds do not keep dogs for long. You must go and check as soon as you realise your dog is missing. Sick or unclaimed animals will be ‘put to sleep’ (euthanised). Any dog unaccompanied outside its compound may be picked up by the council (even if it has a collar, licence and name tag). It is your responsibility to keep your dog inside your compound and accompany it on a leash when outside.
Sometimes pedigree dogs may also be ‘dog-napped’ from inside or outside your premises for sale elsewhere. Make sure you have a lock on your outside gate to prevent this.
If unable to find your dog you may place notices around your area, ask neighbours and perhaps try a newspaper advertisement in the lost and found column. A photograph and promise of reward may help you to retrieve your lost pet. Also leave your name, contact number and a description of your dog at PAWS and SPCA in case your dog is brought in later.

SOS is fighting to conserve what still remains of the Pulai River Estuary through non-antagonistic approaches. They work with the government, local communities and developers in seeking mitigation measures. SOS holds exhibitions aimed at raising public awarenesses besides fundraising activities.
Sources of Funds: Public, corporate sponsors (including Ford Motor Company, Project Aware Foundation)
Our needs

SOS has established a volunteers programme to enable the public to help gather scientific data relevant for conservation of seahorses and seagrass ecosystem.
SOS is currently collecting more petitions in their bid to save the seahorse. The petitions will be sent to the Prime Minister, the Menteri Besar of Johor State and the Ministry of Science, Technology and Environment. Download petitions forms from SOS website.
SOS seeks funding for research, education and conservation works on seahorses and seagrasses at the Pulai River Estuary. Three areas in urgent need of funding:
– Purchase of satellite images of the seagrass beds.
– Construction of an in situ research station.
– A 10-15 ft boat and outboard engine.

APE is an ethical Social Enterprise that works collaboratively with stakeholders to develop sustainable conservation solutions
The 21st Century is witness to increased pressures on the Earth’s natural resources and is calling out for a new approach which balances the needs of people and environment based on the principles of sustainability.
Animal Projects & Environmental Education Sdn. Bhd. (APE Malaysia) is a Social Enterprise that focuses on conservation as a means to enable the wider change towards a sustainable future. Flagship Malaysian species such as orangutans, pygmy elephants, sun bears and marine turtles are used to showcase the complex interrelationships between humans and the environment, allowing everyday people to connect to both the problems and the solutions.
APE Malaysia participates in on-going conservation projects with willing partners who share the same ethos and who are working towards common conservation outcomes. People and organisations can become involved in these projects either through APE’s volunteering program, education program or set up Corporate Responsibility projects. Whether used singly or combined, these methods are used in creative and unique ways to create distinct and dynamic programmes that highlight APE’s model of addressing environment + economics + people in everything it does.
There are 2 project sites at which APE currently delivers this approach. Each site has existing conservation or animal welfare programmes that are run by trustworthy partners, Government departments and/or NGOs. APE’s participation and support are driven by the needs of the individual site and designed to be sustainable.

Over the years , with more volunteers joining us, mainly traveling wives of those working in the oil and gas industry in Brunei and a few local Bruneians, HHP expands to East and West Malaysia with our networks in Miri, Kuching, Kota Kinabalu , Kuala Lumpur , Penang and Johor Barhru. .
On 12th February 2016 , Helping hands Penan is finally registered in Malaysia. We rely on volunteers to carry out our mission and work. We do not have paid staff and incur much overhead. The proceeds from selling their craft is our main mode of fund raising.
Another form of fund-raising is under the charge of a group of our dedicated `Sponsor A Child Education Programme’ committee which was set up in June 2016. Please visit our `HHP Sponsor A Child’ Page. If you would like to sponsor a child, please get in touch with one of our committee.
Our mission is to empower the Penan women to help themselves and their family. We are here to support the Penan in their new ways to settle, but primarily to support the Penan kids to get education by creating an environment that encourages them to start and continue their education.
We buy and sell the craft made by the women folk using their traditional weaving skills to make bags, baskets and mats which are practical for day to say use and make good gifts from this part of the world by its own native.
The fund raised is channelled back to the Penan community in Ulu Limbang and Ulu Baram in our various projects / programmes. Our focus is on educating the Penan children from pre-school to University level (Master) . We aim that one day `Every Penan Child Can go To School’.
Our ongoing Project is `Project Light’ in which we aim to light up as many Penan settlements as possible. Each set of Solar light is rm400 which could light up a house hold. If you wish to be our partner in this project, please get in touch with us.
Brief description ot the PENAN :
The Penan are nomadic aboriginal people living predominantly in Sarawak. They are one of the last few nomads remaining in the world. The Penan are noted for their practice of ‘Molong’ which means never taking more than necessary. Most Penan were nomadic hunter-gatherers until the post-World War II missionaries settled many of the Penan, mainly in the Ulu-Baram and Ulu Limbang district. They hunt for animals which they eat and use the hides, skin, fur, and other parts for clothing and shelter. They gather fruits and plants which are also used as medicines.
Penan communities were predominantly nomadic up until the 1950s. The period from 1950 till present has seen consistent programmes by the state government and foreign Christian missionaries to settle Penan into longhouse-based villages similar to those of Sarawak’s other indigenous groups.
The Penan in Borneo are mainly Semi-nomadic and their way of life is changing due to pressures that encourage them to live in permanent settlements and adopt year-around farming. They are subsistence farmer, growing dry padi, tapioca and corn for consumption. Very often they still return to the forest to hunt and to the river to fish.
Today , the Penan are scattered in many Penan settlements in the forested part of Sarawak. They face challenges of dwindling supply of resources and food. Sending their children to the schools is a momentous task as schools are far away from home.",helpinghandspenan@gmail.com,Helping Hands Penan,http://www.facebook.com/HHPenan,,

Through our very own initiative called Animals Are Our Angels, we at Rhinowrites Communications and Malaysia’s First 365 Days Cat and Dog Calendars are here to help our homeless animals. Personally, we need to consolidate our efforts to help our animals out there in anyway that we can.
Our needs

1. Become a Foster Volunteer
Help us look for people who can foster the animals that we rescue from the streets. Foster volunteers take these animals into their home, providing a safe environment for them to mature, become more socialised, or heal from an existing wound or illness. This can be an intense short-term commitment, but also a very rewarding one. You have made one step forward to helping us re-home the animal.
2. Adopt a Pet or Pass The Message Around
Help us by adopting a dog or a cat. Or pass the word around to your friends and families, forward our emails, etc.
3. For as Low as RM 120, sponsor an animal and save their lives
Sponsor an animal for as low as RM 120 a month, that is RM 3.70 a day. We can work out an auto debit transaction from your savings account or credit card. You will receive a receipt for this sponsorship programme. The animals will be relocated to a no-kill shelter. That means your money is keeping the animals alive.
4. Help someone neuter a pet
If you know of anyone that needs money to neuter their animals, help them. Educate them on why they need to do so. If you don’t have the means to do it, help raise some funds on your own and you will be surprised how many people will come forward to help. And our DBKL clinic in Setapak is reasonably cheap. Call Mr Krishnan @ +6012 258 1041 for more information.
5. Report Abuses
If you know of your neigbours or people who are neglecting or abusing their pets. Please report them. Don’t be afraid. You have to be their voices. The Spca enforcement department and their number is +603-4253 5179.

How we started
The Malaysian Care story is simple yet big in dreams. Sometime in the late 1970s, a group of young Christians were inspired to put their faith into action.  A Board was soon elected in 1978, comprising 11 visionaries like Wong Kim Kong, Lim Heng Seng, Lim Wei Meng, Shirley Lee, Jack Cheah, Liew Chee Kien, Steven Chong and Doreen Chan, with David Boler, Rev. Douglas Anderson and Timothy Phua as advisors.
Malaysian Care became official in 1979 as a registered establishment and started its first home “Rumah Care” which provided shelter for children whose parents were patients at Sungai Buloh Leprosarium. On 1st January 1980, Rev Peter Young was appointed the first Executive Director of Malaysian Care.
From then till now, our purpose remains to encourage active social work amongst the churches in Malaysia, being the visible expression of the wholistic mission of Christ although the expressions of our actions may be have taken different directions according to the needs of the current time.
Where we are today
Malaysian Care today is an organisation offering diversified services such as residential care and community services and is strongly committed to community development. Beginning with just a staff team of five, today we have over 60 staff. Apart from direct services by staff and partners, we seek to inform, educate and encourage Christians to be involved with the poor and deprived. Malaysian Care also offers consultancy, partnerships and networking with Churches and groups to set up social caring ministries across Malaysia.

Presently the villages in this area are being guided by a non-governmental organisation, Foundation for Community Studies and Development (FOCUSED). The villagers told us that FOCUSED has helped them a great deal in being independent and self-sustaining. FOCUSED believes that the best way to help the orang asli is to conduct projects with them where they learn new skills on self-sustenance. FOCUSED also stresses on the importance of education and proper health-care. They are also guided in the proper ways and using the right channels when dealing with the authorities. Therefore, potential contributors are encouraged to work with FOCUSED on helping this community.
NEEDS
Any Volunteer Services Needed: Yes
Description of Needs:
Water to Kampung Keruing is serviced by one manual pump, which pumps water from an underground source. The water supply is usually inconsistent. When there is no water, the village would use water from a nearby freshwater swamp. There is no electricity supply to the villages.  The nearest piped water supply and electricity pole is about 2 km from the villages. Help is needed to think of ways to help improve their situation/organise funds to fund it.
Cash donations are preferred.


Direction/ Map:
Kampung Keruing / Ayer Hitam is located about 1.5 hour’s drive from Kuantan. If you are coming from Kuala Lumpur, take the East West Highway via Karak town and head towards Gambang town. Shortly after passing Gambang, look out for a right turn (at traffic lights) towards Segamat. A road-sign pointing to Segamat can be found at the traffic lights. Go along this road for about 30 minutes. After going on the bridge that crosses the wide Pahang River, look out for a right turn towards Tasik Cini. The villages are located off this main road.

A species of the famed Rafflesia flower (R. cantleyi) can be found in the forest fringes close to the Orang Asli village of Ulu Geroh, in Gopeng, Perak. The SEMAI group was set up with the help of MNS to protect the Rafflesia sites here, through education and awareness among the Semai orang asli community in Ulu Geroh.
The group aims to develop sustainable income to the locals, through responsible eco-tourism activities focused on the Rafflesia as well as the beautiful Rajah Brooke birdwing butterflies, that congregate here in large colonies.
The programme also brings together government agencies, local communities as well as non-governmental organisations towards the management and conservation of the important Rafflesia site.
A one-day package tour is available, which includes viewing of the Rafflesia and Rajah Brooke butterflies, watching a cultural performance and a picnic at the waterfalls.

Sinui Pai Nanek Sengik, in Semai language, means New Life One Heart. SPNS is an informal group of orang asli (aborigines) individuals based in Kampung Chang Lama, Bidor, Perak, started by Tijah Yok Chopil. The present head of SPNS is Ridzuan while Tijah remains as an adviser.
Our objectives
* To provide guidance to orang asli communities in being independent and to encourage them to take responsibility for their own future
* To instill the importance of education
* To instill awareness amongst the orang asli women of their rights and help them become more independent
It was 1986 when it all started, with Tijah giving tuition lessons to the children of Kampung Chang Lama. From working alone, Tijah has over time managed to garner the support of her fellow villagers and with the help of a few of them, SPNS was formed in 1997. From those simple beginnings, SPNS now has projects with other orang asli villages in the nearby States. SPNS now handles several issues, from something as practical as starting a savings scheme for a village to helping the other villages start a kindergarten to organising discussion groups amongst village headmen (tok batin).
Our services
SPNS now runs a kindergarten in Kampung Chang Lama to cater for the village children who are too young to enroll into the government sponsored Tadika KEMAS. The kindergarten is also a care centre for Tadika KEMAS students after school and while their parents are away working.
At the same time and at the invitation of other orang asli villages, representatives of SPNS help them on similar issues. SPNS’ activities now cover 10 orang asli villages in Perak having started Youth Groups in the villages in and round Batang Padang, two in Negeri Sembilan, one in Pahang (Cameron Highlands) and three in Johor.
Most of SPNS’ activities are funded from the shared income of Kampung Chang Lama, the participating villages and the small profits made from a simple provision shop set-up within the village.
Our needs
SPNS has received valuable support from friends to whom they are very thankful for. They have requested HATI to express on their behalf, their heartfelt gratitude to these friends of SPNS. As the work of SPNS is a long-term one, SPNS will continue requiring support to run its activities. At present SPNS is overseeing several projects undertaken by the youth and women of participating orang asli villages. Assistance on a project basis would be ideal. Those who are able to help are encouraged to contact Ridzuan/ Tijah directly.

Headed by Tok Batin, Ebak a/l Pulasan, the Temuan village situated about two to three km from Kampung Kemensah, behind Zoo Negara, Kuala Lumpur comprises 13 families. Total population in the village at time of writing is 63 persons of various ages. There are 8 school-going children in the village.
An interview with Tok Batin Ebak revealed that the Temuan has occupied the area since 1963 while the present village built in 1981. A cluster of wooden houses on stilts and 2 concrete houses form the village. Some of houses were provided by the government. The government has also built a small ‘dewan’ or multi-purposes hall in the village. At the time of our visit, rattan material occupied half the floor space in the dewan.
The villages earn their living mostly by selling the fruits from durian, rambutan, and other fruit trees planted by them in the vicinity. They also have some rubber trees planted in the area. They also collect and sell rattan and bamboo shoots. Some of them work in the city as manual labourers. However, on certain occasions, they were not paid their salary for up to three months and therefore had to stop work as they were not able to cover their cost of travelling into the city to continue the work.
A van picks up the children for school in Kampung Pasir, about five to six km from the village.
Electric power to the village is provided by a fuel generator. Although only less than 10 minutes drive from the township of Taman Melawati, they have not had the benefit of electricity supply all this time. The nearest electricity supply stops at Kampung Kemensah. They also receive some assistance from the Welfare Ministry.

Their source of income is unstable. Therefore they would gladly appreciate any form of assistance to meet their daily needs. They have been seeking the government’s recognition and alienation of about 80 acres of their ancestral land for several years now. However, they have not received any favourable response. Instead they have been told that the identified land has been alienated to a commercial entity. They feel that their future is now even more uncertain. Family members who are able to work would need help to get jobs.

To get there, follow the road beside Zoo Negara into Kampung Kemensah. Pass Kampung Kemensah and head on for about two to three km along a windy road. You will pass 2 wooden bridges with concrete replacements being constructed next to them. A mid-sized stream accompanies the narrow road at certain stretches. To the left, after a distance, you will see occasional notices in red warding off trespasses from a private property. The road splits where a commercial fishing pond sits on your left, take the left fork and follow the road to the village. Due to the recent rainy spell, part of the road has been destroyed. It may still be traversed with a 4WD or a motorbike, but cars will have be parked about 300 meters from the village. It is an easy walk the rest of the way.
The best time to visit is in the afternoon (after 1pm) as Tok Batin Ebak is normally away from the village working in the mornings.",,Kampung Kemensah Orang Asli Village,,,
60,"No 1, Kampung Orang Asli, Chang Lama, 35500 Bidor, Perak",Orang Asli,,Tijah Yok Chopil,"Who are we

Kampung Chang Lama, Sungai Gepai, is situated about five km from Bidor, Perak. The name of the aboriginal village was taken from two rivers in the vicinity, Sungai Gepai and Sungai Chang. Kampung Chang Lama is situated in a hilly area at the foot of the Main Range between two other traditional orang asli villages, Kampung Kuala Senta in the North and Kampung Sandin in the South.
There are over 600 residents in Chang Lama at the time of writing. The village comprises rows of mostly wooden houses, some on stilts. Water supply (sourced from the nearby hills) was provided since 1987 by the Waterworks Department while electricity was provided since 1989. In 1987, the government established a kindergarten, Tadika Kemas, for the children of the village. In 1993, a nearby rural school built in 1962, was converted into a hostel for orang asli children from the interior villages to stay while studying in Bidor.
The Orang Asli in the Kampung Chang Lama is from the Semai community and has occupied the area even before Bidor was established as a tin-mining town in 1861. Based on oral history passed down through generations, the community has occupied the area even before the Malay Sultanate was established in the 15th century. The community has applied for legal title to their ancestral land since the 60’s and they are still awaiting approval.
The community of Kampung Chang Lama earn their living through shared farming on the ancestral land. Jungle produce such as petai, durians, bamboo, rattan and wood products are collected and sold in the nearby town markets and represent a major source of income. In the 80’s, the village ventured into oil palm planting with technical and financial assistance from RISDA. Total planted area is about 100 acres. According to them, the assistance from RISDA was recently suspended. As a result, they now have to fend for themselves in managing the oil palm plantings. The village has to resort to relying on credit terms offered by the factory that buys the oil palm produce from them and their own funds (which is already very thin) to manage the plantings. Because of the lack of funds, they are not able to purchase enough fertiliser for the crops which will evidently have adverse effects on oil palm yields.
The village also runs a small provision shop to serve its own community. Also, the village has simple and traditional accommodation for rent by the public. Along with accommodation and food, they also provide four programmes for the visitors to participate in for a fee. The four programmes are fishing, traditional hunting using blowpipes (sumpitan), traditional cooking and a course on traditional herbal plants. This enterprising venture offers another source of income to the village.
Based in Kampung Chang Lama is SPNS (Sinui Pai Nanek Sengik meaning New Life One Heart), a grouping of dedicated orang asli members initiated by Tijak Yok Chopil, now headed by Ridzuan, who is teaching independence and instilling the importance of education to their own community as well as communities from other orang asli villages (see separate listing for SPNS).
Type of Housing (Single Storey House, bungalows etc): village like cluster of single storey houses

62,39 Jalan Kampung Hulu Malacca 75200 Malaysia,Advocacy/Children/Refugees,,,"Same Skies honours the resilience, capacity and skills of refugee and asylum seeker communities. We support people to support themselves. We see the people we work with as capable actors to strengthen their own communities while living in limbo, waiting for asylum claims to be processed and durable solutions to be found. We provide educational, technical, logistical and financial assistance to empower communities. We deliver training in project design and management, fundraising and other topic as required.
The establishment of Same Skies was inspired by the founders’ many years of international refugee work, including on Nauru and Manus Island.
We realised that refugees are too often perceived as vulnerable or even as a burden, and that their needs are still mostly defined by outsiders. The consequence are often expensive, top-down assistance programmes that let the potential of refugees go to waste. There is an urgent need for innovative approaches that have the capacity to address enormous global challenges, while at the same time genuinely empowering displaced communities to live with self-determination and dignity.
Our ideology is simple: people own their own lives, whatever their situation. Hence, we value and strengthen existing capacities. Simple… yet very innovative! We do not have “beneficiaries”; we have partners! It is all about what people can do for themselves and each other. ​
Refugee protection should be about collectively creating an environment that allows everyone to claim their rights. ​
Our utmost achievement is that we help communities to lift themselves out of a state of inactivity, depression and trauma. And along with the social benefits, utilising existing capacities enables us to be more cost-effective than common approaches.

Special things come about when you least expect it. Rizq ar Rahman was born out of such an unexpected but significant meeting a few years ago between two ladies with very different backgrounds but united by an incredible drive to make the world a better place.
Our founders, Assila Emir & Fatima Syeda Jaleel, came together bringing along their own passion and strengths in different areas of charitable work and turned it into a foundation with the hopes of being an umbrella over many charitable projects.
The name Rizq ar Rahman, which means “All provision (is from) God, the Most Merciful”. It bears great significance for the founders as it represents the very essence of what the foundation is built on. Rizq ar Rahman is driven by the belief that all provisions ultimately come from God.
Rizq Ar Rahman  found so many people desperately in need of help; often their voices and cries unheard.  We strive to become their voice. To serve as a conduit through which provision could be better channelled so that the poor would go hungry less often, and the generous find a trustworthy means of delivering their contributions directly to those most in need.
We are an organisation run by independent people who dedicate their time solely to make a difference. Our founding members have been active in the community almost 3 years, helping to distribute charitable contributions effectively to worthy causes, first hand. We make extensive efforts to regularly meet and understand the challenges of all of our causes.
If you feel you can help us to improve our initiatives, we welcome you to volunteer!

Refugee Information
First of all, you must know that at the end of September 2015, there were around 153,850 refugees and asylum-seekers registered with UNHCR in Malaysia. Some 57% of refugees and asylum-seekers are men, while 43% are women. Also, there are 33,740 children below the age of 18.
Secondly, the population of Malaysia in the year of 2013 equalled to 29.72 million, while the population of Kuala Lumpur equals to 1.589 million. Unfortunately, there are no proven statistics regarding the number of undocumented foreigners in the country.
Adding to that, there are no refugee camps in Malaysia and refugees live in small low cost over crowded flats in Kuala Lumpur and Selangor areas. And there are no legal or administrative frameworks in place in country in order to address the refugee situation. Also, there is no difference between refugees and undocumented migrants in Malaysian law, therefore the possibility of them getting arrested is quite high and they have no access to formal employment. Nevertheless, their children don’t have access to formal education. Even though they have access to health care but the costs are usually unaffordable for them.
Therefore, Rising Hands Organization tries to help and solve these issues by introducing different approaches and programs. We are looking forward your support in contributing donations or funds to our programs. Your supports are highly appreciated.",rhamalaysia@gmail.com,Rising Hands Association,http://www.rha.org.my,,
68,"52 C, Jalan Kemuja, Bangsar Utama, 59000, Kuala Lumpur, MALAYSIA  ",Education/Refugees/Youth,+6 012 252 1711 (Black),,"Who are we
UBU comprises of youth and universities students from various areas in Kuala Lumpur. As a progressive, democratic and concerned youth and students group, we are very much involved in providing our energy, creativity, ideas and ideals in community based activities and programmes with underprivileged and marginalised communities.
We feel that a bridge between student sector and other oppressed sectors from society should be built to link and strengthen the various pro-democracy forces in our country. For a long time a vacuum has existed between the student sector and other sectors in society.
At this point in time, there are not many programmes and activities being implemented to bridge and link students other sectors in society. As such, it seems that student groups in our country are isolated from the rest of society.
Our programmes
We feel that this situation should be addressed through committed initiative to fill in the social vacuum with various community-based programmes and activities, which are dynamic and progressive.
This vacuum needs to be filled before the gap between students and other sectors in society becomes bigger and bigger. The involvement of students in community based programmes and other activities that are pro-people need to be implemented without any delay.
Hence, initiatives and continuous commitment from the students must be implemented from now on through progressive educational programmes and activities.
We feel these programmes and activities should be handled and organised by the students themselves as a means for them to be independent, critical and creative in organising themselves as well as in organising the people they work with.
Our challenges

However, the bureaucratic structure in all universities in Malaysia today has stifled the growth of students to be independent minded, creative, progressive and critical in looking at and being involved in issues that affect society.
Student Affairs Division – Bahagian Hal Ehwal Pelajar (HEP) was formed to control and monitor student programmes and activities. This means that programmes and activities organised by students must get permission and approval from HEP before they can be implemented.
All activities that are seen as undesirable in the eyes of HEP such as students putting up a firm stand on human rights violation in Malaysia or student involvement with democratic reform in Malaysia, are dealt with in a very undemocratic and severe manner. Either students involved are reprimanded, suspended or expelled; or their proposed programmes and activities are rejected.
The campuses climate and environment that are not conducive; the democratic space and opportunities for the student to be intellectually developed and expanded being stifled; and the enforcement of repressive laws of Universities and University Colleges Act (UUCA) preventing students from involving in pro-democracy activism; is definitely not a suitable element in order to produce students and youths that are committed, courageous, creative, critical and full of idealism.
Why University of Bangsar Utama ?
Since 1998, an area in Bangsar Utama has become a place for student activists from various campuses in Kuala Lumpur to hang out and discuss progressive theories, current affairs and issues as well as looking at how we can contribute and participate actively in democratic reform in our country.
From a mere discussion, it evolved into the implementation of our ideas and ideals when we finally decided to rent a space in Bangsar Utama on April 2000 as our base and operational center to plan and implement all our community based programs and activities.
Choosing the name for our own little democratic place as University of Bangsar Utama is for re-socialising and re-educating ourselves as responsible students and youths for the benefit of society.
Programs and Activities
Our programs and activities are based on cultivating, nurturing and building the personality of students and youths to be confident and conscious, progressive and democratic, creative and courageous, critical and responsible.
We feel that the best methodology to install such positive virtues is through education and training programs. Therefore, our programs and activities offered to the communities, youth and students are based on Education Programs.
Our education programs are divided into 3 categories. First, education programs for the community in Bangsar Utama. Second, for the students in various university campuses in Kuala Lumpur and third for the public.
Community of Bangsar Utama
Our programmes are:
All the programmes and activities offered are free of charge.
Our programmes for University Students and Youth include:
Our programmes for the general public include:
Educational Street Theatre and Agit-prop performance for the public
Musical performances with progressive songs for the public
Our street theatre, agit-prop, music and songs include progressive element on human rights, democracy and social justice.
Democratic Reform and Civil and Political Rights Movement
UBU student activists are also involved in the struggle for democratic reform and civil and political right movement by participating in civil disobedience. SUARAM is one of the NGOs that UBU student activists have a working relationship with.
Our student activists have been selected by SUARAM to join a Fact Finding Mission for Achenes Refugees in 1999 and as Observers in the Indonesian 1999 General Election organised by Asian Network For Free and Fair Elections (ANFREL).
Last year, we also collaborated with SUARAM as a joint organiser for protest against Internal Security Act (ISA) in front of ISA Detention Centre in Kamunting.
In November 1999, with assistance from ERA (Education Research Association) we had organised a Human Rights Training Camp for five days in Port Dickson with more than 60 students from various campuses in Malaysia join the programmes.
And in March 2001 together with SUARAM we organised a two day Human Rights Workshop on Police Power and Citizen Rights for university students and youths.
Our aspirations

With this brief introduction of us as the University of Bangsar Utama Student Group, our programmes and activities as well as what we stand for, our ideas and ideals of contributing actively for the advancement of democratic reform and the building of a just society in our country; we hope that a further commitment and relationship can be explored, advanced and achieved between us.",universiti_bangsar@yahoo.com,Universiti Bangsar Utama (UBU),,,

AOHD (Archdiocesan Office for Human Development) is the official arm of the Catholic Church, in the Archdiocese of Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, entrusted with overseeing matters pertaining to the promotion of charity, integral human development, justice and peace. it is managed by the AOHD Secretariat and Board of Management with Rev Mitchel Anthony as the Priest Delegate.
History
The “Aggiornamento-Renewal” of 1976 brought into focus the need for the Church in Malaysia to begin its process of renewal by identifying Integral Human Development (IHD) as one of her core needs. Thus, began the journey of the Church in Malaysia to express her “preferential option for the poor”, through Charity, Integral Human Development, Justice and Peace.
This saw the gradual establishment of Offices for Human Development in each of the Arch/Dioceses. The thrust initiated by the Catholic Welfare Services (CWS) / National Office for Human Development (NOHD), as a result of the decision of the Peninsular Malaysia Catholic Bishops, was to set up the Peninsular Malaysia Lenten Campaign Committee. The resultant awareness and education was the vehicle to deepen our understanding of the meaning of our Christian commitment to living the gospels today. Structures for formation, direct services to the needy and administration, including the responsibility to make available financial resources were set up. By the year 1995, the Arch/Dioceses in Peninsular Malaysia adopted Program the Programme Approach as a response to Vision 2020. We identified our priority areas as follows:
With the growing demands of the various ministries especially in the Archdiocese of Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, it was deemed necessary to set up the Archdiocesan Office for Human Development (AOHD) in separate premises from the NOHD, where it had originally been located since its establishment in the 1990s. This “separation” was the result of the increasing programs, activities and services at the level of the Archdiocese, as well as our growing conviction for the need to link our Parish Integral Human Development Ministries (PIHDMs) with our Basic Ecclesial Communities (BECs). Thus, one of the priority area of focus of the AOHD is to set up PIHDMs in every parish, so that more effective pastoral care can be given to people who are suffering and in pain in the Archdiocese of Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.
Our vision 
To be one with God, in solidarity with the whole human family and creation.
Our mission
To witness to Christ through service, integral human development, justice and peace.

MMK (Migrant Ministry Klang) Malaysia started off in 2002 with the focus to bring the gospel to migrant workers that lived in the Klang area. However, along the years, it has also begun reaching out to refugees and those who are in need.
Our purpose
MMK’s main purpose is to reach out to the people that God has placed at our doorsteps. We do this through various means and methods – conducting regular weekly services in each ethnic group, conducting evangelistic meetings, providing medical services, running refugee schools, holding group camps, and most recently, setting up a cottage industry to fund the needs of refugees.
Through the preaching ministry, MMK has witnessed hundreds of baptisms yearly, along with an even higher number of decisions made for Christ. The weekly Sunday Services have itself spawned to having multiple services within the week at various locations across Klang Valley.
We believe not just in conversions of souls, but also the development and discipling of future full-time workers and Christian leaders.

A small group of Korean expatriates and Malaysians living in Kuala Lumpur (Ampang, Selangor) recognised the predicament faced by the refugees and started an initiative to help them. The main effort is to provide basic education for children and was started in premises provided by a Korean language studio in Ampang. Initially an informal class had been started to teach simple English to Afghan children. A small group of 7 children started class in October 2007. Teachers served on a voluntary basis. Some Korean expatriates, Malaysian individuals, Uzbekistan nationals and a German residing in Ampang, Selangor offered their services to teach. Later more social workers joined in to provide their services and help. With humble beginnings the Hilla Community Centre in AMPANG, SELANGOR (Hilla) was born. The name ‘Hilla’ comes from the Pashto language of the Afghan people that mean ‘hope’. It is indeed our heart’s desire to give hope to the Afghans and other refugee communities. We try to give them a start through education because we firmly believe that ‘education is the beacon of hope’ that can transform individuals and communities to be successful and better people.
Through Hilla, we reach out to the people in need of help .The classes began to grow bigger as more Afghan parents came to Hilla to request that their children be admitted for classes. As more people came in, space became a constraint and larger premises were needed. Eventually, in January 2008 the centre moved to a double storey corner link house in Ampang. Two classes were formed with 30 plus students. Initially, only students below 15 years old were admitted. However, later more demand came from older people. This includes older siblings and some parents who also want to learn English. By 2010 the centre has 5 classes with a total of 19 volunteer teachers. The total enrolment of students attending day classes is 65.
The students age between seven and 19 years old. Day classes are conducted from Mondays to Saturdays, 9am to 1pm. Parents are encouraged to attend separate night classes as the approach to teach adults is different. Initially the centre focused on Afghan refugees. However people from other refugee communities, e.g. Myanmar refugees, also approached the centre to admit their children.  Today the centre strives to reach out to all refugee communities in need of assistance regardless of their nationality, religion or creed.
Our services

The centre started with teaching English. Learning the language was an urgent matter for the refugees as most of them spoke only their own mother tongue. They need the English language to communicate with other people as well as prepare for their future relocation to a foreign land. As more volunteer teachers came forward to provide their services, the centre progressively was able to offer education for more subjects. Today the classes conducted include Bahasa Malaysia, Mathematics, Science, Arts and Craft, Piano, Vocal and Computers. Educational trips are organized to enhance the students learning experience. The centre also has an adjacent piece of land within its compound. Physical education classes are conducted here. It also serves as both a playground and activities centre for the students. In 2009, the Malaysian Ministry of Education announced that refugees are allowed to sit for the local government examinations. Hilla need to look forward to employ proper tutors to assist the students in their studies  for the exams.
The centre has also embarked on the initiative to provide job training and counseling for adult refugees. A flat near the Hilla Community Centre had been rented for the purpose. Adults and older students are taught working skills. The subjects include computer skills and hairdressing. Where possible, we also assist to find work for the adults. This includes jobs like tailoring, baking, cleaning, furniture removal and sales assistants.
Our vision
Our vision and aim is to help the refugee communities in Ampang, Selangor through education and job training. We aim to provide them with basic education and some job skills to improve their situation and self-esteem.
The Hilla Community Centre was started with charitable contributions from kind hearted individuals. The money collected is used to pay for the costs incurred in running our school and training centre. This includes the rental of the school premises, books, stationery, utilities, maintenance, transportation costs and teachers’ allowance. We take the students for educational outings and sports competition with other refugee schools. For this we incur transportation, admission ticket and other incidental costs. The following table lists our estimated monthly expenses.
Our Funding
 The money to finance our rental, utilities, administrative costs, stationery, teaching material, transportation and other costs come from kind hearted public donors. We held a Charity Sale in 2008 to raise funds and hope to do it again. Our total monthly expenses amounts to approximately RM 7,000 per month.
Our appeal
It is our hope to provide as much education as possible to prepare the students for their future but we are constrained by the availability of teachers who are willing to contribute their services as part of social work. We appeal for more individuals to come forward to help in this area. Within the limitations of our resources and funds we try to help as many people as we can. We also appeal for more donations and consistent sponsorships to help finance our operational costs and educational activities.

Who are we

United Learning Centre (ULC) is a volunteer driven centre providing children of Burmese refugees with an education. These children do not have access to schools in Malaysia due to their parents’ refugee status.
The centre provides education for the children to help prepare them for resettlement in a third country, without this education, especially learning the English language, most of these children end up begging on the streets or be victims of human traffickers.  School equipment such as computers, books and meals, as well as activities to complete the education process for a school going children, are all provided by ULC through public donations.
Our needs
Located just behind Imbi road and the busy commercial area of Bukit Bintang, ULC runs SOLELY on public contribution, such as books, food, furniture and volunteer teachers. Currently over 100 children are attending classes at ULC, which is supported by SIBKL.
Funds for rental and utilities are also sought through fund raising campaigns.   Parents pay a school fee to enrol their children in ULC.  The centre accepts Burmese children from all ethnicities and communities.
Message from the volunteers that run ULC
“All of us here at the centre are volunteers and we incur zero administrative cost. All the donations go to the children, all 100% of contributions. We would like to collect funds to provide lunch, education and prepare them to be accepted by a third country like the United States and Australia so that they can have a brighter future. Without any English Language skills, their chances are minimal. Meanwhile the learning centre helps keep the children off the streets and safely away from human traffickers who are always on the look out to sell them to beggar syndicates who will mutilate them and ship them to another country. Scary as it seems, unfortunately reality can sometimes be harsh and unkind.”

92,"KM28.5 Jalan Kuang, Lorong Teratai, Kampong Damai, 48050 Kuang, Selangor Darul Ehsan, Malaysia",Children/Single parents,+603 6038 2823 ,,"Sejarah kami
Idea untuk menubuhkan sebuah pusat perlindungan bagi anak-anak yatim di Kuang ini, bermula pada pertengahan tahun 1989. Sejarah bermula apabila seorang bapa telah meninggal dunia dengan meninggalkan 9 orang anak kecil dalam tanggungannya. Susulan daripada kejadian itu, anak-anak yatim tersebut telah dijadikan keluarga angkat oleh Tuan Haji Suhaimi Bin Dzajuli selama lebih kurang sebelas bulan.
Kebetulan pula pada masa itu, Tuan Haji Suhaimi Bin Dzajuli adalah Imam masjid Al-Islahiyah batu 17 ¾ Kuang. Hal ini pula diketahui oleh ahli jawatan kuasa Masjid Al-Islahiyah dan masing-masing merasakan bahawa suatu usaha yang lebih baik harus dilakukan demi kebajikan anak-anak tersebut di masa akan datang. Maka lahirlah satu kata sepakat untuk menubuhkan sebuah asrama anak-anak yatim di Kuang.
Alhamdulillah, hasrat ini terus menjadi kenyataan apabila seorang hamba Allah telah mewakafkan sebidang tanah seluas 0.5 ekar di Lorong teratai, Kuang bagi tujuan pembinaan asrama tersebut dan pemegang hak milik tanah tersebut telah diserahkan kepada Bahagian Wakaf, Majlis Agama Islam Selangor (MAIS) dan Masjid Al-Islahiah Kuang telah menubuhkan Jawatankuasa sementara bagi menguruskan asrama anak yatim di tanah tersebut.
Jawatankuasa yang dipengerusikan oleh Tuan Haji Suhaimi telah memulakan kerja-kerja bagi mendapatkan pembiayaan untuk membina bangunan asas bagi menempatkan anak-anak yatim tersebut. Pembiayaan daripada orang persendirian dan syarikat korporat telah membantu Jawatankuasa tersebut bagi membina satu blok penempatan bagi keluarga malang tersebut.
Perkembangan pusat ini telah menarik perhatian ramai dimana pada tahun 1991 seramai 74 orang anak-anak yatim telah di tempatkan di pusat ini. Kebanyakan mereka adalah penduduk yang berada di sekitar dan Negeri Selangor. Perletakan batu asas Asrama Damai ini pula telah dilakukan pada hari Ahad, 18 Oktober 1992 bersamaan 22 Rabiulakhir 1413 Hijrah oleh Y.B Dato’ Abu Bakar bin Abdul Hamid, DSSA, SMS, PPK, PJK. Beliau ketika itu merupakan ahli majlis mesyuarat kerajaan negeri Selangor Darul Ehsan.
Dari masa ke semasa penghuni asrama ini semakin bertambah dan pertambahan juga pada keluasan asrama tanah wakaf asrama kepada enpat ekar di atas nama waqaf untuk Asrama Damai, Kuang. Asrama ini pernah dikunjungi oleh Al-Marhum Yang di-Pertuan Agong Sultan Salahuddin Abdul Aziz Shah, bersama bersama Tuanku Permaisuri untuk mencemar duli bagi melawat seluruh kawasan asrama ini.
Keperluan kami
Pada masa ini asrama menempatkan seramai 116 orang anak-anak yatim serta 11 orang ibu-ibu tunggal yang menghuni asrama ini. Manakala bagi tenaga pengurusan asrama ini melibatkan 15 orang dan dibantu oleh ibu-ibu tunggal tersebut. Perbelanjaan bagi menguruskan asrama melibatkan kos yang tinggi dan semakin meningkat dimana dianggarkan sebanyak RM 30 – 40 ribu sebulan diperlukan bagi membiayai perbelanjaan bulanan asrama.
Pembiayaan asrama ini adalah melalui pembiayaan pihak swasta dan orang perseorangan dan pihak pengurusan asrama sentiasa berusaha keras bagi memberi kehidupan yang lebih baik kepada anak-anak yatim disini demi menjamin masa depan mereka yang lebih cerah dan sempurna.

Medical Equipment
One of our key focus areas is supplying poor patients with the basic medical needs. Working with government hospitals and welfare departments we identify needy patients that require medical equipment and supplies that are not subsidised by the government. Some of these equipment are vital for post hospital care and most to ensure a decent quality of life for poor patients. Some of the equipment and supplies that we provide.
Single Mothers
Parenting is a tough and crucial responsibility. It is harder and extremely challenging if you are a single mother,what more when you are financially poor.
According to a Malaysian study focusing on urban single mothers who are largely from the low income level:
At PPPM we believe we should not let single moms face these challenges alone. We believe its our duty to help in the betterment of these critical lives.
Financial Aid
At PPPM we identify single mothers that are financially unstable and help them with financial aid. Potential candidates are carefully reviewed and aid is given according to their needs.
Our officers closely monitor these families to ensure their basic needs are fulfilled and their quality of life is improved.
Support
Financial aid is only a single part in our efforts to enrich the lives of single mothers and their children. We provide counselling services and carry out workshops for single mothers. These workshops are focused on providing single mothers job opportunities and valuable skills.
Hardcore Poor
The importance of a stable financial income is utterly important to ensure the basic rights and needs are met. All of us deserve the very basic in terms of shelter, food and clothing. PPPM works with welfare departments to provide financial aid for the hardcore poor.
Aid provided ranges for monthly contributions to need based allocations. Our officers carefully study each application before funds are disbursed.

ABOUT
The AUTORR Foundation Centre is a rest and recreation centre for senior citizens and their families. It is the first of its kind in Malaysia. The AUTORR Foundation Centre is a place where the elders can participate in fun-filled activities to keep them active and healthy.
The AUTORR Foundation Centre is an excellent place for the elders to meet new friends and have social interaction with their peers. Here at the AUTORR Foundation Centre, the elders can also learn new skills and  share their lifelong wealth of experience and  knowledge with their new-found friends and the younger generation.
The AUTORR Foundation was founded by Yap Swee Lin, fondly known as Lin Chua – the grand-daughter of Malaya’s last Chinese Kapitan, the late Kapitan Yap Kwan Seng.
The AUTORR Foundation Centre is built upon land donated by Lin. After observing an alarming trend that old folks spend a lot of time at home with very little physical and mental activities, Lin followed the philanthropic footsteps of her grandfather and initiated the project now known as the AUTORR (Aged Unite To Organize Rest & Recreation) Foundation.
The AUTORR Foundation Centre is a non-profit, non-racial and non religious place for the senior citizens to keep themselves occupied with fun-filled activities and to keep their social circles.
The Centre is not an old folk’s home. The elderly do not stay here but rather they can come in and out of the centre at anytime for however long that they want to join in the activities or just to relax and have tea. At the end of the day, they must go home to their families.
The AUTORR Foundation was founded based on the principal to provide senior citizens a social place where they can go to for rest and recreation with their contemporaries.
Since its conception through to its realization, The AUTORR Foundation has successfully gained the endorsement and blessings of government agencies such as:
The AUTORR Foundation Centre now stands as the fruit and testament of the labour of love brought forth by numerous charity fund raising drives and also from charitable donations.
NEEDS
Volunteers are most welcome. The AUTORR Foundation is a non-profit organization that aims to improve the physical and mental health of senior citizens in Malaysia. They are constantly looking for people with big heart who will join them in this effort for a good cause. Reach out and make a difference.
They are now working extremely hard to get donations & sponsorships to fill-up the entire centre before expected operations before end of 2012. All contributions are Income Tax Exempted (LDHN.01/35/42/51/179-6.5672).
You, your team members & friends, and family members are welcome to visit the centre to have a better insight on their centre’s mission & objectives. Please contact for an appointment for the site visit from 9a.m. – 5p.m. (Mon – Fri).

116,,Advocacy/Children/Differently Abled/Education/Environment/Other Communities/Recommended,+6012 2872 077 ,,,"Who we are

We help people learn social values through nature as a teaching medium. Social values like growing a strong foundation, being a force for good, collaboration while maintaining individuality, life-giving leadership, and so on. We find that these values are shared by both man (social) and nature (ecological). For example, ‘fruitfulness’ is a common value and purpose in both nature and humans. And just as ‘diversity’ makes a natural ecosystem resilient, so does it foster better human societies. In building that understanding, we hope that people may be inspired by the goodness of nature to bring about the goodness of humanity.
Good Stewards is the first to conduct a programme like this. To be what we advocate – transforming society for good – we run it as a social enterprise. That means while we’re doing what we love, we include underprivileged brothers and sisters in the program. Also, any profits go to them after paying ourselves a modest salary.
Why are we doing this
We think it’s fabulous to be reflecting on good ol’ virtues and values in the good ol’ woods. But after getting cold feet about actually doing it for good people, we’re glad that there’s much more that motivate us besides a fabulous idea.  We believe our society can become better in many ways – daily compassion, more creativity in life ambitions, care for the needy. And it starts with the individual. Because when we choose to make a better society, we choose to first make a difference in ourselves.
And so it is our deed as Good Stewards. We hope to inspire and encourage a few to embrace a higher calling in life – for small deeds done everyday is no ordinary feat. It is also our hope that people who share our program will be moved to see that the nature that surrounds and nurtures us is in great need too of small acts of kindness and love. 
 This program is designed with the youth in mind, although anyone from 10 – 110 will find it inspiring. Participants are encouraged to reflect on three social values that matter to individuals and our society today. We facilitate that by sharing how the same three values can actually be seen in nature. In the beautiful, lush and fruitful forest, we point out to participants that nature is brimming with goodness. By making the connection, that the forest is good and fruitful and that the same social values are present in the forest, we hope to inspire our participants to value these values. Perhaps the imagery of becoming a good and fruitful forest can then accompany them in their journey of life.
Here’s an example of what we mean. We value diversity in our society. It is a wonderful social value that stems from acceptance, respect for others and celebration of variety. We can point out the great diversity in Malaysian society – an almost endless feast of different ethnic foods, festivities that bind us, a staggering richness in folk art, and so on. So how can we be inspired by nature to protect diversity as a social value? Diversity of life-forms is almost always a defining feature of healthy ecosystems. In the forest, we point out the many layers of plant life at different sections, and the myriad animal communities that they support. Whenever a forest loses diversity, it becomes less fruitful by losing its ability to support as many animals, or becoming more prone to pest destruction. Sometimes, a forest ecosystem deprived of its key diversity can become so destabilised that it collapses. By making the connection between the social sphere and the natural world in a common value, we encourage our participants to see the value of diversity in an inspiring setting. Hopefully, the goodness and fruitfulness of a forest full of diversity can serve to strengthen our participant’s appreciation of diversity in their life journey.
As we walk through the forest, stopping at attractions and pretty spots (canopy walkway, stream, etc), participants are actively engaged through lively narration, games, personal storytelling and the thriving wildlife. A lovely personal journal with artworks is given to every participant to help in reflection. Views are heard and respected, time is taken to linger. Stories are shared over a delicious lunch. At the end of the walk, we will bring together the day’s learning at a very special spot, and encourage participants to find their place in the great journey towards a better society.
We do our best to serve the unique needs of our participants. This means we will spend time beforehand to listen to each group’s needs and particular journey, customise and tweak the syllabus and conduct follow-up after the program. We therefore encourage group leaders or guardians to the participants to join the program, at no charge. This way, the learning and reflection can continue beyond the program with others who can encourage and build up.

Time: 9am – 3pm
Fees: RM 900 per group of up to 6 persons (1-2 facilitators) / RM 1800 per group of up to 15 persons (2 facilitators)
Fees include lunch & snacks, a personal journal for each participant, FRIM admission fees.
Group leaders/guardians are invited to join at no charge.
We also customised programmes for schools and corporations
We include the underprivileged as part of our work. And we do this as our customers join our programs, because part of the fees go to subsidising our work with them. We do not wait till our salaries are paid to bless the underprivileged as we do it side-by-side with our work for paying customers.Here’s how:
We are keen to share the blessings with the following underprivileged folks:
– Orphans
– Children of single parents, especially mothers
– People from troubled backgrounds
– Refugees
Because we believe in effecting lasting change, we choose to work with organisations already working with the underprivileged. This way, we can complement the good work they are already doing.

This will indirectly reduce their dependency on family and caregivers, thus paving a way for a brighter future and a more meaningful life.
This is a stepping stone for them who otherwise would be confined to their homes as there are limited opportunities for them in Melaka. Over the past ten years, more focus has been given to the physically disabled. Special schools can only enrol those with learning disabilities until the age of 20 years. After that, it is up to the individual’s families to fend for themselves or get into vocational training centres under the Government if they meet the criteria.
Without this service, the people we represent would face a life of seclusion and social isolation. Since the service commenced, we have trained more than 100 students with our intake coming from homes, schools, welfare centres and other NGO’s.
Joy Workshop is registered with the Registrar of Societies, Inland Revenue Board and the Welfare Department.
Our objectives
The Future
To build a vocational centre to train mentally-challenged adults for employment viability and independent living. This will include a sheltered workshop, a thrift shop, canteen, classes (specializing in craft work, sewing and functional academics), gymnasium, resource library, multi-purpose hall, a group home and hostel facilities.

For the last 24 years, since 1984, CHILD has lent itself to the cause of Tamil schools to help them regain their rightful place, identity and self-respect in the National education system. CHILD’s engagement has helped to transform the study culture of Tamil school children and forge an amiable working partnership between parents, teachers and the community in many Tamil Schools. Meanwhile, the long-term association of 25 years with Tamil Schools has afforded CHILD the opportunity to study the Tamil school problems comprehensively and test several different remedial modalities to improve student performance.
Our objectives
The major objectives of CHILD are to help less advantaged children realise their potential and have the courage to dream; and to foster understanding and cooperation among children of all cultures in the spirit of love, compassion and reverence. CHILD achieves these objectives by providing educational assistance for the disadvantaged and less fortunate needy children and youths, irrespective of race, religion or creed. CHILD also assists Tamil School children to attain parity with children in National Schools in academic performance.
Our services
PRESCHOOL is designed to address some issues in Tamil schools. Early childhood education among this low socio-economic group is vital to give them a good head start and prepare them for primary education. Tamil schools lack preschools. If shortage of more than 750 trained teachers in Tamil schools adds to the problem the latter is further compounded by the increasing enrolment in Tamil schools.
Comprehensive Integrated Tamil School Program (CITS) attempts to address the issues of Tamil schools. There is a lack of parental support for many poor Tamil children studying in Tamil schools. The high failure rate is largely due to poor parental care, concern and support. CITS is specifically designed to compensate for these deficiencies.
Reading and Writing (RAW) helps in attaining early skills in English language and improve its proficiency. Project Inspire help addresses the problems faced by slow learners.
CARE was designed to help these students to maintain their grades and at the same time provide them with skills to be leaders of the community. Many students with good grades in the UPSR fail to take advantage when they leave Tamil schools and join National Schools in form one.

Happiness centre is a safe haven for the intellectually and physically challenged  children of Melaka. This home was founded by Mr. Roy Collar, in  2000. Children who have no one to love or care for them are the first ones to gain acceptance into this special home. Most of these precious children are either abandoned or come from very poor families. Some of them come from broken or single parent homes. Their families are not able to send them to institutions, workshops or day-care centres, which expect a monthly fee.
Observation from Hati.my’s site visit: “But with the number of children, some of whom are fast becoming adults, their needs have grown, and the manager has said they are in dire need of funds for the long term. Most of these differently abled children are left behind by parents too poor to look after them on their own, and also have no time to support the place by visiting the children they left behind. “
Happiness centre on the other hand do not charge any fees, the reason being that the poor innocent children will be left to degenerate, because the families are not able to come up with the up-keep fee.
There are 35 inmates at the home and all are physically or mentally disabled. Their ages range from 5 years to 34 years. All of these special children are not able to fend for themselves, even for their most basic needs. 20 of them require pampers and 21 of them have to be fed. Most of these children have multiple disabilities ranging from cerebral palsy, polio paralysis, speech impairment blindness and mental disorders.
Our services
Happiness centre employs 10 caretakers to cater to the children’s needs.  Most of all they try to shower them with love and affection. The utmost priority of the centre is that the children are always clean and in pink of health. With GOD’S help and the generosity of the caring public, they try to keep this centre operational and hope to raise enough funds to buy own premises, so as to able to cater to more of these special children. Happiness Centre tries to give them a dignified life and hope that in some small way, they may be able to enjoy a little sunshine in their lives.
Number of Paid Staff: 10
Estimated Monthly Expenditure: Approximately RM17,000
Our needs
“We need funds to pay our 10 care-givers who cater to the children on a 24 hour basis and for other monthly needs.”
Volunteers are very welcome. Please contact organisation to arrange how you can help.
Besides funds to cover monthly expenses including salaries, the home would welcome recyclables, and food provisions as well including fresh foods.

Our objectives
The Home was set up with the main objective of providing a stable environment for girls from the squatter areas. Emphasis is placed on education as a means to create a better life for them and to ‘rescue’ their families from their current environment.
The Home aims to create a caring environment where the girls may develop fully, as any child would in the care of their natural parents in a loving home.

This Residential Care Centre was started in November 1993 by Maria and Edmund who came to stay in Kulim in 1993. The organisation is registered with the Registrar of Companies as Sunshine Cottage. In November 2004, they registered with the Jabatan Kebajikan dan Kemasyarakatan Malaysia (Department of Social Welfare) in Kulim, Kedah and now is known as Sunshine Cottage Welfare Society.
Our aims
The vision at Sunshine Cottage is to shape a happy and friendly environment that can facilitate the growth of each individual in order to develop his or her full potential. Each person is given the opportunity to experience care and support and discover a taste of what life can offer should they choose to grasp it.
We provide
– Food, Shelter and Clothing
– Education up to Secondary School
– Simple Recreational Facilities
– Limited Vocational Training
– Counselling
There are six homes altogether, namely
1) children
2) senior citizens(men),
3) senior citizens(women)
4) disabled,
5) youth,
6) nursery.
Our achievements
More than 300 children, handicapped persons and senior citizens have been cared for, since its inception. Most of the past residents (children/youth) of the Home have gone on to get good jobs and have settled down well.  Some have got married. Some have reunited with their families. Others have acquired new skills.
Currently they have about 83 dependents, made up of children, disabled persons, senior citizens and teenagers/youth. The Home is managed by a committee of 20 members, many with a background in welfare /social work.
Our needs

Volunteers are needed to help with fundraising. The homes are urgently appealing for funds. The homes have been facing difficulty in raising enough to cover monthly expenses. Other than that, volunteers are needed to assist students in the lower secondary / primary levels. Volunteers to care for handicapped children (Day Care).
The funds are for rental, utilities, transport and school expenses and to caregivers and volunteers. Sunshine Cottage depends mainly on monthly pledges – they want to raise it from current 10 pledgers to up to 100. The home is also hoping for a sponsor to ensure a consistent stream of finances just to cover the basics.
Only one church is donating RM150-250 bimonthly and the current 10 pledgers offer RM1,500 per monthly.
Non-cash donations:
– Food stuff (dry rations)
– Teaching aids
– Furniture for their centres
– Old clothes and old newspapers to be recycled
Due to the fact of their financial status being unsteady, they have been unable to settle the rentals & utilities in the time, thus causing a disconnection of electricity and water facilities a couple of times. They are collecting for a Building Fund to fund 8 buildings to form an activity centre for their residents and community. The Building Fund target amount is RM 2.2 million.
Donations in cash or by cheque. Payments by cheque must be payable to ‘SUNSHINE COTTAGE WELFARE SOCIETY’

These families, especially the children need more than just food on the table, they needed a home, a shelter for the children to heal their deep emotional, spiritual and mental wounds in their lives. The home is registered with the State Welfare Department in Klang.
This realisation thus brought about the setting up of Philea Home with the aim of providing shelter to abused children up to the age of 18.

Bridges EIP Centre was set up as a non-profit community project by Petaling Jaya Evangelical Free Church (PJEFC) to help children with learning disabilities become more self-reliant. Their work covers disorders or syndromes which affects a child’s learning curve or development, particularly, Attention Deficit Hyperactive Disorder, Down Syndrome, Autism Disorder Spectrum, Cerebral Palsy, and Global Development Delay. The Centre is open to special children of all races and religion aged six years and below. It currently has 19 children under its tutelage. The children are taught on a one-on-one basis by a trained teacher, who is assisted by volunteers. At the time of writing, Bridges is unable to take in more children due to the shortage of trained teachers.
Our programmes
At Bridges, the children undergo the Early Intervention Programme (EIP). EIP is built on the philosophy that support and help should be given at the earliest possible age when a disability is diagnosed or suspected so that the child is given the opportunity to develop to his/her full potential. It is a structured educational programme consisting of fun activities that incorporate all the main areas of a child’s development. Before starting the programme, every child is assessed and the parents interviewed so that an individualised education plan can be drawn up. The children attend sessions twice a week, with each session lasting about two-and-a-half hours. Time is set aside for individual work as well as group activities to encourage social interaction. At least one parent accompanies the child throughout the session so that follow-up work can be done at home.
Our needs
It is currently funded by the PJEFC and has 1 permanent staff. Children at the Centre pay fees of about RM100 per month. However, fee exemptions are sometimes made on a case-by-case basis.
Number of Paid Staff: 1
Estimated Monthly Expenditure: RM7,000
Bridges EIP welcomes interested volunteer to help working with children. Good in music, art and craft, baking.
Full-time teachers as the number of children we are able to take in depends on our manpower. The organisation works with pre-school children and is usually the first stop for parents with special needs children. The centre does a lot of one-to-one work with the children.

The society was officially registered with 11 core members. The number of core members has since increased to more than 50.
Our services
The society’s main project is the ‘Day Centre for Special Children’. Together the 11 members combined their resources to set up the Day Centre by renting the lower part of a two storey kampung (village) house. (The owner of the house stayed with his family on the upper storey). It was very small, only able to accommodate about 20 people.
Two years later, the local government donated a single storey bungalow at the current address. This enabled the Society to increase it’s dependents to the current total of 15. With additional dependents, a new problem arise. There is not enough funds to cater to the expenses of the Day Centre. Hence the Committee members had to start charging the dependents RM50 each per month for van fare (the Centre provides transportation to and from the children’s house) and meals (previously the services were free). This is to ensure the prolonged sustainability of the Day Centre. Nevertheless, there are instances where dependents are not able to afford even the monthly charge, and for such cases, the centre continues to accept and help the said dependents. The Society hopes that with enough funding and help from the Public, they will not have to charge these dependents in the future.
The Day Centre only caters to children aged 18 years and below, who are disabled.
Our objectives

Our dependents

To date there are 15 dependents of various disability:cerebral palsy, hydrocephalus, autistic, hyperactive, down syndrome, slow learner, physically handicapped, mentally retarded (mild and severe), dyslexia, speech problems and multiple handicap (A child with more than one handicap eg.Down syndrome, autistic and hyperactive).
Our needs

The institution was set up in 1947 by the then Ministry of Social Welfare. It is situated about 3km from the town of Seremban. In 1978, the institution was designated especially for the care and training of mentally handicapped children.
Accordingly it was renamed to its current name from State Home for Children, in honour of its Royal Patron, DYMM Tuanku Ampuan of Negeri Sembilan. Until 1983, the institution provided care for all categories of mentally disabled children with low to average functioning abilities. From 1984, it accepted only children below the age of 14 and who were educable. Since 1994, the institution has been gazetted as a shelter home for needy children under the Child Protection Act, 1991. Today the institution is home to about 100 children of various races. The children of the institution suffer from diseases such as cerebral palsy, Down’s Syndrome, hydrocephalus, speech and hearing impairments.
Our objectives

Our services
In addition to the services of a full-time nurse, a medical officer from the Negeri Sembilan Health Department visits the institution twice a month. The institution’s dental clinic is run by the Seremban District Dental Clinic staff comprising a dentist, a nurse and an attendant. The clinic operates twice a week. Besides receiving treatment, the children are taught proper dental care.
The institution is administered by a Principal and 47 staff members consisting of a trained nurse, social welfare assistants, administrative assistants, health attendants, general workers, cooks, guard and driver. two teachers are employed by the Board of Visitors to carry out activities suited to the needs of the children. The institution has in the past obtained the services of and professional guidance from members of the American Corps, Japanese Overseas Volunteer Corps and British Volunteers Service Organisation.
Members to the Board of Visitors are appointed by the Minister of National Unity and Social Development and such appointment, which is in force for a period of 3 years at a time, is gazetted. The services of the members are voluntary. The role of the Board is to complement and supplement the efforts of the Ministry of National Unity and Social Development, State Welfare Department and other related government agencies, aimed at enhancing, to the fullest possible, the quality of life of the children in the institution.
Our needs
Any Volunteer Services Needed: Yes!
The home is presently understaffed and therefore would require committed volunteers on a regular basis. Specifically, the home requires the services of a qualified Hydro- therapist to train the children in its swimming pool. Other than that, volunteers are welcome to participate in a few activities/programmes such as:-
1.Daily Living Activities – For children who can not manage themselves, life skills training involving basic hygiene such as brushing teeth, bathing, dressing, eating and drinking, making beds and socialize with their peers.
2. Special classes (Pre-School Activities) – For children who can handle themselves and be trained in certain skills.
3. Art classes – For children who have the ability to craft and have the potential to progress in vocational training.
4. Occupational Therapy – Treatments to develop, recover, or maintain the daily living and work skills of the children with a physical, mental or developmental condition.
5. Cultural and Music Therapy – The use of music to cure, alleviate or stimulate. An overall recovery methods applied to help improve body movement and physical coordination.
6. Multi-sensory Therapy (Snoezelen) – A type of therapy for people with autism or developmental disabilities. It consists of placing the person in a soothing and stimulating environment, the “snoezelen room”. These rooms are specially designed to deliver stimuli to various senses, using lighting effects, colour, sounds, music, scents, etc. The combination of different materials on a wall may be explored using tactile senses, and the floor may be adjusted to stimulate the sense of balance.
Contributions in the form of funds, equipment, materials and volunteers are very much appreciated. In particular, experts in the various fields of care for the special children. Funds for daily expenses are covered by the Ministry, but the home requires funds for expansion or improvements in the home. They are also looking for funds to hold a convention in September where experts from Singapore on specialised equipment for disabled children are invited to provide training.

Association of the Network for the Needs of Children with Disability (Perak) was officially registered by the Registrar of Societies in 1996.(Reg no. 4213/96). Network was formed by parents who have children with disability together with professionals & interested individuals. The main aims are:-
1) To create and foster a cooperative networking of the various social agencies involved in meeting the needs of children with disabilities
2) To promote continuous, effective planning to benefit the children with disabilities and their parents and carers
3) To ensure the availability of a comprehensive pool of relevant resources for the use of all concerned parties
Network tries to make available to parents information, resources, services, training and the support available in and outside the region to help their children obtain information on disability condition and rehabilitation facilities, assist in the setting up of other services and support group. Network aims to stimulate parents to be more proactive in caring for the needs of their children. Network hopes that every child who is disabled and their parents will be able to receive the care they require – physical, mental, emotional and spiritual. One of the foundational roles is to be a liaison body. Network links parents with other parents, parents with carers, parents with resources (governmental and non-governmental), therapists with other services & resources, etc. As part of Network’s established (regular) services, they have a Resource Centre/Helpline and a one-stop registration centre for the Welfare and Education Departments operated with the cooperation of the Paediatric Clinic of the Ipoh Hospital (servicing about 750 registrations a year). Network also serves an important role as a training organisation to improve the existing services available. It conducts workshops to train teachers, health care workers and parents in the management of children with disabilities.
Our needs
Estimated Monthly Expenditure: more than RM25,000 per year
Volunteers are needed and welcome!
Network continues to be challenged by parents to provide care for their children with disability, especially in areas where such care is not currently available. They hope to expand their services in the following areas (future plans) and welcome all forms of assistance in the following areas:
1) The development of a home rehabilitation service for parents. Many parents are not able to come to existing centres or the hospital due to their family situation – this lack of access to basic rehabilitation services is distressing. Network hopes to hire a therapist who could provide home based care and develop home programmes, especially with house-bound mothers. The person should preferable be an Occupational Therapist. The expected annual expenditure for this programme would be in the range of RM 30,000 with the majority going towards a reasonable monthly salary of the therapist and travelling expenses.
2) There is also a need to provide “private” special education to an unusual group of underserved children. Currently special education can be obtained in integrated classes with the Education Department (useful for those with mild to moderate intellectual impairment) and with a NGO (useful for those with moderate to severe intellectual impairment). There are however a significant number of children who are intelligent but not able to articulate or be educated effectively because of a handicap. Many of them have specific learning disabilities. These children are not served by the existing services. Parents at Network would like to explore the possibility of running a private service for these children with a special education teacher. They initially looked to resourcing a special education teacher from an overseas country who could be funded by an agency from that country but have not been successful. They now hope to find someone locally (preferably English speaking to minimize communication problems) to run this service. Parents who enrolled their child in such a scheme would also be asked to pay some “tuition” fees to support the work. The expected annual expenditure for this programme (including monthly of the special education teacher) would be in the range of RM 35,000.
3) Many children are unable to afford specialised equipment (e.g. hearing aids, specialised seating, electronic wheelchairs, walker framers, etc.) The cost of these equipments, imported from overseas, are in the range of RM 5,000 to RM7000 each. Network hopes to purchase some of these mobility equipments from overseas (wooden variety) and source for a local carpenter to make a large number locally so that the cost will be reduced and then make them available to the children. The cost of this project is RM80,000 (purchase of some equipment, payment for carpenter, materials).
4) Finally, meeting the annual operating cost of NETWORK has always been a struggle. In the past Network did not receive any grants or monetary assistance and relied completely on the contribution of its committee members comprising mainly parents and professionals. In recent years, as their activities have expanded and they have recruited full time staff, the expenses have increased. Now Network receives some financial assistance from the Welfare Department (RM5000 annually), other NGOs, fund raising activities, individuals and from conducting training courses. Network has largely relied on public donations and contributions from its committee members to translate its aspirations into reality. Their current annual expenditure is RM 25,000.

PERKOBP has its origin as an informal support group formed in early 1992 by a group of parents who were concerned with the welfare of their children with learning difficulties. At that time, about 25 families took turns to meet in their homes to discuss the needs of their teenage children who had just completed various training programmes. There were no further services available for them nor could they hold a job because of their learning difficulties. The group got itself registered with the ROS as a society on 20th Nov 1993.
Currently, they have about 300 members. Membership is open to parents/guardians of persons with learning difficulties. Membership form can be obtained from Mr Chng Cheng Hui or Ms Ho Lin Mur at the centre at 6th mile Jalan Puchong or you may write to their registered address PERKOBP No: 44, Jalan Hujan Bubuk 2, Taman Overseas Union, 58200, Kuala Lumpur.

Gurpuri Foundation was established on 27 Oct 2000 to provide shelter and care to children who had none. It is now an established, non-profit provider of care services for children in Malaysia. Committed to advocating for disadvantaged children, the foundation identifies areas of greatest need for children and youth, and works in partnership with the community to meet those needs.
Gurpuri Foundation was founded as part of a nationwide movement to get orphaned children into a loving and caring environment where they can blossom into responsible adults.
Giani Sukhdaiv Singh Ji with the support of the Malaysian Sikh community established Gurpuri Foundation. Gurpuri Foundation runs with support from the Malaysian Sikh Community and well-wishers throughout the world.
History
Economic changes in the last two decades have affected the community in Malaysia. In the families who were in the margins of poverty level, the lack of economic opportunities and strong social influences affected them severely. This led to a growing number of families facing monetary problems, which in turn affected their children.
Some concerned members of the local community came forward to create a place in every mind and heart where each child has dignity and respect. To provide a home and care for the children of the families, with the objective of motivating these children by making them responsible citizens of the future through proper care and education.
Our services

Gurpuri Foundation presently provides for the needs of 47 children. We humbly invite you to join in the development of these children. You may provide us with services or expertise to help develop the children and youth at Gurpuri.
Donations to the foundation can be made on a monthly basis or on a lump sum basis. All monetary contribution is utilised for the children in areas of personal development and necessities. In accordance with our tradition, a monthly prayer on a joint basis will be held for our kind donors and their families.
How you can help

Your generosity and care can make a difference to ensure that these disadvantaged children are provided with the necessities of life in a good up-bringing.
The time has come for the community to give these unfortunate children a better future. At Gurpuri, the children’s wants and needs will be taken care of. They will have their basic day to day needs looked after from shelter to clothing, food and social skills.
Over and above this their education would be given an upmost attention. Our aim is that when they leave Gurpuri they are equipped with all the necessary skills to be good citizens and exemplary members of the community.
The idea is not only to give these children of ours the basic needs of up bringing but to provide the best, one can to transform them into noble citizens.
Our needs

The National Early Childhood Intervention Council (NECIC) was initiated by a group of NGOs and set-up in 2011 with the role to promote and emphasise the crucial components of effective early childhood intervention. The National Council acts as a forum to discuss, advocate, monitor and review all policies and actions related to children with disabilities.
Besides our main activity which is the biennial national conference, we are constantly engaging in dialogues with groups such as UNICEF, Child Rights Coalition of Malaysia (CRCM), SUHAKAM and government agencies such as PEMANDU, Ministry of Education (MOE), Ministry of Health (MOH) and Jabatan Kebajikan Kebajikan (JKM).
Our history
In 2003, John Foster, the CEO of Noah’s Ark Victoria Australia (a leading early childhood intervention service provider) visited Malaysia and this led to the development of a staff exchange program between Malaysia and Australia in the field of early childhood intervention.
This exchange involves Australia sending one or two professionals over to conduct training workshops in various locations for a duration of 2-3 weeks. And in 2004, our first 2 candidates from Malaysia (Asia Community Service and Malaysia Care) were hosted by Noah’s Ark for over three weeks in Victoria. They visited 13 centres and attended the 24th OMEP World Organisation for Early Childhood Education) Conference and the 6th Biennial National Early Childhood Intervention Australia (ECIA) Conference.
The idea of gathering interested people together to discuss early childhood intervention issues in Malaysia was then mooted in 2005 by a group of seven NGO service providers in this field. They were Asia Community Service, Bethany Home, JJ Resources, Malaysian Care, New Horizons Society, Persatuan Kanak-Kanak Istimewa Kajang and Wings Melaka, The Early Childhood Intervention Symposium was held at the Grand Bluewave Hotel in Shah Alam from 12th -14th August 2005 and attended by over 100 participants.
This has led to several national conferences being held in Penang (2006), Kota Kinabalu (2008), Melaka (2010) and Sibu(2012).The NECI Conferences seem to have good stream of followers basing on the number of participants. In order to provide direction and consistency for future conferences, it was felt that a national council should seriously be established. The role of the National Council would be to advocate on early childhood intervention matters arising from the conferences and also provide a voice on current issues. A pro tem committee consisting of representatives from various states was set-up to look into the constitutional and the formal registration of this National Council.

Malaysia Hindu Sangam  is a brain child of the late Shri K. Paramalingam KMN. He was a barrister at law and was then the Director General of Public Trustee Department. He was greatly assisted by the late Shri K. Ramanathan, a lawyer by profession and an ardent Hindu. Shri K. Ramanathan was the president of Malaysian Indian Congress from 1950 – 1951. He was also the founder of Malaysian Arulneri Thirukkuttam.
By the encouragement and inspiration given by the learned saintly Shri K. Ramanathan, Shri K. Paramalingam moved fast and gathered few devout Hindus, who liked to serve the course of Hinduism and society at large. As a result of his untiring efforts, Shri. K. Paramalingam, Shri. G. V. Thevar, Shri Hari Chand Saradha, Shri. S. Palanivel Pillai and Shri S. Dhuraiappah, met on 15 April 1963.  At the meeting, they formed an ad-hoc committee.
This committee then prepared the groundwork to form an organisation for Hindus in Malaysia. Finally, in January 1965, the ad-hoc committee organised a seminar of all Hindu organisations and some leading temples met at the famous Maha Mariamman temple, High Street (now Jalan Tun H. S. Lee) Kuala Lumpur. At this meeting, the name Malaysia Hindu Sangam was chosen and it was officially registered under the Companies Act on 23 January 1965.

192,"P.O. Box 12712, 50786 Kuala Lumpur",Advocacy/Health,,,"It was not an easy beginning for the MPA. It was not that the first meeting called by Dr. M P Deva of the Department of Psychological Medicine, University of Malaya to discuss the formation of the Malaysian Psychiatric Association in November 1976 was not well attended at the Hospital Kuala Lumpur. In fact it was just the opposite, it attracted 17 psychiatrists out of the approximately 25 in the country, and other staff. It was a trying time for psychiatry in Malaysia with about a dozen psychiatrists out of perhaps 25 leaving or planning to leave for greener pastures down under. The mental hospitals were overflowing with well over 8000 patients in conditions that would have been unthinkable today. The Hospital Bahagia had pioneered in 1970s a Day Care in Ipoh where the institutionalised mentally ill were ferried several times a week to an empty private home for and outing, games a sample of life outside the mental hospital. The 2 year Masters in Psychological Medicine programme of University of Malaya which started in 1973, graduated its second batch of one psychiatrist, and was facing a bleak drought of new trainees. But perhaps the bigger immediate threat was from among a few of the profession and many in one other specialities who felt that the MPA as a concept was not a wise one, as there was already a Neuro-psychiatric society of the Malaysian Medical Association. Luckily the majority of the psychiatrists prevailed and the MPA was formally inaugurated by the Honourable Minister of Health Tan Sri Lee Siok Yew on 19th March 1977 at Hospital Bahagia, Ulu Kinta. Dato Seri M. Mahadevan was elected as the MPA’s First protem President with Dr. M P Deva as pro tem Hon Gen Secretary. The election was followed by a scientific session on The Move to Community Psychiatry in Malaysia.
Scientific Meetings
The initial years saw the first monthly Scientific/Clinical meetings first held at the Nurses Lecture theatre of, GHKL and later held in UHKL, UKM and GHKL on rotation. It became more regular after 1981 until the introduction of the Quarterly Scientific meetings. This was initiated by Prof Ramli Hassan in 1993 and the 1st QSM was on Child Psychiatry held on 20/2/93 at the Institute of Paediatrics KL attended by 48 participants. This became a regular meeting discussing various topics of interest in psychiatry and Mental Health and held mainly in KL. On the 23rd Nov. 1996 the first QSM was held outside KL in Johor Bahru on care of the Elderly and the next one in February 1997 at GH Kota Bharu on Community Mental Health.
Conferences
The MPA under the Chairmanship of Dato Seri Dr M. Mahadevan organised its first major conference in 1983 – the 4th ASEAN Forum on Child and Adolescent Psychiatry at the Institute of Neurological Sciences Kuala Lumpur.
The First Malaysian Conference on Psychological Medicine (MCPM) was initiated and organized by A. Prof Dr M. P. Deva at the Faculty of Medicine, University of Malaya in 1988. The MPA under his leadership also organised the 2nd MCPM at the Ming Court Hotel Kuala Lumpur from 23rd to 25th February 1990. Since then the MCPM has become the premier biannual Scientific Meeting for Psychiatrist and Mental Health Workers in Malaysia.
The MPA organized the 3rd Malaysian Conference on Psychological Medicine from the 17th – 19th January 1992 at Sri Bayu Beach Resort attended by 280 delegates with Dr Mohd Fadzil Man as organising chairman. The 4th MCPM organised by Prof Ramli Hassan as chairman on 14th – 16th January 1994 attended by 188 delegates. The 5th MCPM was held in Hotel Sofitel Johor Bahru from 8th – 10th March 1996 under the chairmanship of Dr S. Jeyarajah and attended by more than 200 delegates. The MCPM is now an annual conference, currently in its 12th Session in 2006.
Awards
In conjunction with the MCPM the MPA also introduced two awards since 1994. The Best Psychiatric Research Award for the 3 best papers presented at the MCPM. These awards are sponsored by Novartis and Pfizer.
The MPA Book Prize of RM 500.00 for the Best Psychiatric Trainee for the Masters Program at University Malaya & UKM.
Joining ASEAN Federation for Psychiatry and Mental Health
In 1981, the 3rd ASEAN Forum on Child and Adolescent Psychiatry was held in Bangkok, Thailand. At a special session in February 11, 1981, the AFPMH was established and the MPA joined the AFPMH as a founder member with Dato Seri Dr. M Mahadevan representing the MPA and signing the Constitution on behalf of the MPA. The Founding of the AFPMH was attended by all the Presidents of the ASEAN National Psychiatric Associations. Prof Kusumanto Setyonogoro of Indonesia was elected Founder President for a 4 year term. In 1985 the Secretariat was transferred to Thailand with General Aroon Showanasai as the 2nd president of the AFPMH. The 3rd president of AFPMH was Prof Tsoi Wing Foo of Singapore from 1987 to 1989.
The Malaysian Psychiatric Association took over the Secretariat in 1990 when A. Prof Dr M. P. Deva was the 4th President and Dr S. Jeyarajah was Secretary General. The MPA successfully organised the 3rd ASEAN Congress on Psychiatry and Mental Health (since called the AFPMH Congress) and the 7th Forum on Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (AFCAP) from 24th – 27th January, 1991 at the KL Hilton Hotel attended by 275 foreign, ASEAN and local delegates.
At the 6th AFPMH Congress held in Bangkok in November, 1996, Dr S. Jeyarajah was elected to next President of the AFPMH and the Secretariat passed over to the MPA. The MPA organised the 7th AFPMH Congress and 11th AFCAP in December 1998. The 12th AFPM Congress celebrating the 25th Anniversary of AFPMH was held in Jakarta in July 2006 where Prof R Kusumanto Setyenegoro the Founder President was honoured with a special plaque and Prof. M P Deva gave the address honouring Prof Kusumanto’s pioneering work in forming Asia’s first Regional Psychiatric Association.
The Asean Journal of Psychiatry was first published by the Singapore Psychiatric Association and in 1996-1997 by MPA under the editorship of Prof Dr M. P. Deva.
Joining The World Psychiatric Association (WPA)
The MPA was from 1977 till 1981 a National Psychiatric Association and in 1981 when it joined the AFPMH, it had started to have international links and these have opened the doors to the wider world. In 1988 the MPA joined the WPA as a member This has led to wider links not only at WPA sponsored meetings but also at the General Assemblies of the WPA where the MPA has voting rights. The last General Assembly attracted over 100 country- delegates from all 6 continents MPA is in Zone XVI of the WPA in Region 4 that covers South Asia. MPA’s former president Prof M P Deva was the Zone XVI representative of WPA for 16 years from 1989 to 2005.
Publications
The MPA soon after its formation started to keep tabs with its far flung members in Sabah, Sarawak, and different parts of peninsular Malaysia through mimeographed copies of an MPA Newsletter printed and posted by the first Secretary with no funding – as there was no bank account or bank balance to support a newsletter. This went on for many years until with the growing availability of funds and support in 1992, a ‘Berita MPA’ was finally printed by Prof Maniam and colleagues in UKM. The Malaysian Psychiatry is now a Quarterly Newsletter of the MPA, which has undergone changes from the early MPA Newsletter in 1978 to ‘Berita MPA’ in 1992 and since 1995 as ‘Malaysian Psychiatry’.
The Malaysian Journal of Psychiatry was first published in October 1993 under the editorship of A. Prof Dr K Saroja. It is a 6 monthly journal and although belated at times has been successfully continued as the ‘Orange Journal of Malaysian Psychiatry’. Assoc. Prof Dr Hatta Shaharom was appointed Editor in September 1996 followed by Prof Azhar Md. Zain. The current Editor-in-Chief is Prof Dr Nor Zuraida Zainal, who has managed the Journal since 2008.
The Malaysian Journal of Psychiatry went online in June 2006 and has since been upgraded to include an online author submission and reviewer management system. MJP is available online at www.mjpsychiatry.org.

Policy making and healthcare training
The MPA is concerned with several issues among which are:
1. The National Mental Health Policy
2. The New Mental Health Act
3. Ethical Code of members
4. Public Health Education
5. Mental Health Insurance
Training of doctors and GP in psychiatry will take a prominent role for future activities apartfrom continuing our present CME programme.
International Assistance in Disasters
The MPA was one of the first to respond to the psychosocial needs of survivors of the cataclysm of the South Asian Tsunami in December 2004. The MPA cooperating with the International disaster Relief Organisation Mercy Malaysia sent out teams of psychiatrists in relays to the worst hit areas of Acheh in Indonesia and Kalmunai in eastern Sri Lanka to provide, relief and training This went on for over 5 months in 2005.
Future Directions
The role of the psychiatric profession in Malaysia is far from over. The country has not by a long shot achieved mental health for all in this country, not withstanding the Almaty declaration. The mental hospitals are not ideal places in which to routinely treat the mentally ill. Their custodial image and their place in negating and stigmatising both the profession and the mentally ill is something that despite the proliferation of psychiatrists we in MPA have not come to grips with. There does not seem to be any movement forward in de-stigmatisation. At the same time there is talk about building large and new mental hospitals rather than move concertedly into the community. The MPA can play an important role in making the facts about ill effects of institutional care half a century after the discovery of chlorpromazine and well into the area of Clozapine, Risperidone, CBT and PSR, known to decision makers who are, sadly, going the wrong way.
Malaysia may not have fully solved all our problems in mental health and care of the mentally ill, but it may surprise many in the profession that there are dozens of countries whose mental health staff have even less expertise than us. In the past several years, doctors, psychiatrists and nurses from several neighbouring and distant countries, like Pakistan, Tanzania, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Vietnam, Korea, Laos, Cambodia, PNG and Mongolia have spent days, weeks and months or even years learning from our experience in mental health. Yet others have been impressed by our progress through our training them in their own countries. What can the MPA do in this growing field of international exchange and cooperation?
The MPA can actually do a lot. Many years ago it was Dr. M P Deva of the MPA, who proposed the ASEAN Traveling Fellowship, through the AFPMH. It can extend further beyond these countries by both inviting psychiatrists from needy countries to see our progress in mental health and perhaps sponsoring our own MPA psychiatrists to teach overseas in short courses for nurses, GPs and even postgraduate trainees. Malaysia is a country well known for its warm spirit of giving and sharing our knowledge and expertise in caring for the neglected area of mental health is surely likely to take the MPA to new heights. Another even less expensive way to help the needy is to regularly send our journals to countries in the region who sometimes have not received any journal on psychiatry for decades and live off the 1970s textbooks.
The MPA has come a long way in the 30 years since it was started in HBHK one hot and sweltering afternoon in the non-air conditioned hall of the school of nursing. It meets in 5 star hotels now and instead of 20 or so, we have about 200 of us. But simply numbers alone and passive observers are not enough for the future of MPA. We have to have new pioneers to take over from those who laid the foundations of what the MPA is today. They however must be tempered with that indomitable spirit and willingness, as Ulysses said, to seek, to find and not to yield!",info@psychiatry-malaysia.org,Malaysian Psychiatric Association,http://www.psychiatry-malaysia.org,,

WE SERVE 3900 MEALS A WEEK; AMOUNTING TO 15,600 MEALS A MONTH! The needs have increased immensely with people constantly knocking at our doors everyday to take them in but we lack finance and other resources to house, care and feed them. The Global Street Mission Society requires RM 720K per annum to run the above operations.
How you can help
1. Our operation is not funded by any government body or organisation. We rely on the generosity of public donations.
2. We do not charge any fee for most of the destitute and homeless people we take in as they can’t even afford to take care of themselves; let alone pay for the care fees.
3. We experience difficulty most of the time in paying rental and utility charges at the premises we are renting to house these destitute and homeless.
4. All staff receive a meagre allowance for the long hours of hard work and dedication they put in to care for these destitute and homeless people from administration to operations.
5. Most of the time, we can’t afford to buy good and nutritious food to these people as we do not have the budget to provide for them. We eat whatever remnants of vegetables and on some good days, small fish given by the markets vegetable sellers and fishmongers. A handful of companies sponsor bread and other food supplies.
6. The need is great and we want to help these destitute and homeless as we have the expertise, the endurance and the heart to care for them but we do not have the means of renting more places to house them, food to feed them and to provide the basic necessities which totals to a large monetary figure when all these are accounted for.
What we offer at our homes
1. No care fees imposed; We only accept small monetary token as and when the family can afford.
2. We do not give up on the individuals when they fail to assimilate into the mainstream of society; be it for the first, second or third time.
3. We continue to receive them back into our homes / centres, to rehabilitate their attitude and characters, to provide after-care counselling, to care and love them until they are ready to stand on their own again.
4. We adopt the comprehensive holistic approach where we take in and care for the whole family instead of just the troubled individuals in the hope of family reconciliation and re-building the individuals / families into strong citizens of the society.",enquiries@globalstreetmission.org,Global Street Mission,http://www.globalstreetmission.org/about.html,,

Founded in 1996, Reef Check is the world’s largest international coral reef monitoring programme involving volunteer recreational divers and marine scientists.
First carried out on a large scale in 1997, it provided the first solid evidence that coral reefs have been damaged on a global scale. The survey raised the awareness of scientists, governments, politicians and the general public about the value of coral reefs, threats to their health and solutions to coral reef problems.
In August 2002, Reef Check released its five-year report, The Global Coral Reef Crisis – Trends and Solutions. Based on data collected in over 80 countries, the report was the first scientific documentation of the dramatic worldwide decline in coral reef health over the previous five years. The rate of decline and the global extent of the damage are alarming. There is virtually no reef in the world that remains untouched by human impacts, such as over fishing, pollution and climate change. Yet the success stories discussed in the report show that, with proper monitoring, management and protection, our coral reefs can recover. It is up to us.
Today, Reef Checks are conducted annually at sites around the world, in order to continually monitor the state of the world’s reefs. Reef Check teams have been sponsored by a number of large corporations and have worked with many businesses in tourism, diving, surfing and the marine aquarium trade, to develop mutually beneficial solutions – including the creation of self-funding Marine Protected Areas.

If parents could detect their children who have difficulties, be it physiological, psychological, or social, and seek for appropriate treatment and therapy, children will be able to adjust positively, facilitating children’s holistic growth, which in turn will prevent parents from feelings of inadequacy, anxieties or guilt.

Projek bernama POSITIVE SHELTER HOME ( POSHE ) adalah sabuah rumah perantaraan (half-way-home) dan perlindungan untuk kanak-kanak dan wanita dewasa pembawa HIV/AIDS. Projek ini adalah dibawah Pertubuhan Pelindungan Pembawa HIV Positif Wilayah Persekutuan dan Selangor yang telah didaftar dengan Registration Of Society (ROS) pada bulan Januari 2009. Projek ini telah dihasilkan dengan tujuan untuk melindung, menjaga dan membela hak kanak-kanak dan memulih semangat wanita dewasa. Berikutan fenomena tragik HIV/AIDS di Malaysia sekarang, jumlah kanak-kanak yatim/piatu pembawa HIV/AIDS juga bertambah. POSHE sekarang mempunyai 8 kanak-kanak yang menjadi mangsa HIV Positif dan mereka bergantung dengan ubat untuk meneruskan kehidupan selagi belum ada ubat penawar untuk menghapuskan virus yang ada dalam darah mereka. Nasib mereka ini juga masih menghadapi stigma dan disriminasi.

Keperluan kami

Semenjak POSHE beroperasi mulai Januari 2009 hingga sekarang kami masih menerima panggilan untuk tinggal bersama kaum senasib tetapi kami tidak dapat melayan kerana peruntukan dana yang kecil. Kanak-kanak terdiri dari ibu dengan anak bawah umur, kanak-kanak yang ditinggalkan dijalanan, kanak-kanak kematian ibu-bapa & tiada waris yang sanggup melihara serta kanak-kanak yang dibuang selepas dilahirkan. Harapan untuk mereka meneruskan kehidupan atau menghabiskan sisa hidup sebagai pembawa HIV Positif mendapat berkat dari Allah swt dengan persedian bekalan mereka untuk dunia dan akhirat. Paling penting mereka dapat merasa kehidupan berkonsep kekeluargaan dalam rumah sendiri tanpa merasa terasing dan tersisih.
BANTUAN ANDA
Untuk rawatan kesihatan setiap penghuni wajib berjumpa doctor untuk rawatan lanjutan, mendapatkan bekalan ubat dan sebagainya. Kami memerlukan kenderaan untuk membawa mereka dan bila balik nanti akan membawa balik bekalan ubat-ubatan yang diberi oleh pihat hospital untuk bekalan tiga bulan bagi setiap penghuni HIV positif.
Untuk persekolahan, kenderaan juga sangat diperlukan untuk menhantar kanak-kanak pergi dan balik sekolah bagi dua sessi.
Kami juga perlukan kenderaan untuk membeli-belah barangan dan keperluan rumah dan barangan dapur dipasar.

The Penang Cheshire Home was established in 1978 by Toh Puan Datuk Hajjah Sardiah (Consort of Tun Hj. Sardon Jubir, the then Governor of Penang) together with a group of volunteers, with the noble aim of housing the physically handicapped. Over the years, the Home became synonymous with the rehabilitation of the disabled.
The Home began in a humble way. Donations from a generous public enabled a wing of the former Po Leung Kuk Home to be renovated and refurbished to house the pioneer batch of six residents.
Our services
As the years passed by, the Home steadily grew in stature and structure until it is now fully operational with a large hall which doubles as a refectory cum recreation room, a work area, dormitories, an office, a kitchen and a storeroom. A physiotherapy room and a clinic complete the setup.
The ground floor of the double storey Training Centre Block houses a conference room which can be rented out to the public to generate funds. Upstairs are hostel facilities for visitors and members of other Cheshire Homes.
The Administrator and his staff see to the day-to-day operations of the Home, with support from a Management Committee.
The Home aims to help the physically disabled adjust to life by training them to become independent and to be able to take their rightful place in society among their able-bodied brethren, with dignity.
Both male and female applicants, aged 12 – 45, are admitted on the recommendation of the Home’s doctors. A minimum fee of RM100.00 per month per resident is payable. Day residents are also welcome and they each contribute RM50.00 monthly.
The Home also provides aid for needy ex-residents on a monthly basis. This includes essential items such as rice and sugar, and educational aid for their children, at RM50.00 for a primary school student and RM100.00 for a secondary school student. Furthermore, respite care is given to disabled people who may need temporary accommodation and other support.
In relaxed, homely surroundings, the residents specialize in making handicraft of their choice, which are sold both inside as well as outside the Home. This scheme enhances their self-esteem and self-worth. Furthermore, to help integrate them into society, jobs are sourced for them in factories and sheltered work places.

As for recreation and for maintaining a dynamic link with the outside world, the Cheshire Home Scout Troop was established with the specific aim of preparing the residents to become well-adjusted and useful citizens. Refreshing and motivational activities are planned for these “special scouts” (official terminology) enabling them to interact with regular scouts from schools. These include kite-flying, sandcastle-building, canoeing, backwoodsman cooking, flying-foxing, paint-balling and camping. This comprehensive scouting programme has thus far taken our special scouts to beaches, hill resorts and agoonorees (jamborees for special scouts) both locally as well as in other states and faraway countries.
Our needs
A very meaningful pathway into community involvement is by way of our Foster Parents Scheme whereby an individual or a corporate citizen “adopts” a resident by contributing RM360.00 per annum. A Foster Parents Day is held annually to formally acknowledge and celebrate the caring and generous spirit of the Foster Parents.
Moreover, should you wish to take your adopted child for an outing or to celebrate a happy occasion with the residents, you are most welcome.
As our Home is a voluntary organisation, we gladly welcome any form of support or donation in cash or kind. Furthermore, should you have some time to spare, you are most welcome to serve as a volunteer worker in our common effort to rehabilitate the residents and to enrich their lives.
The Penang Cheshire Home is a registered charity organisation and all cash donations are tax-exempt.",cheshirepg@yahoo.com,Penang Cheshire Home,http://www.penangcheshirehome.org,,

In undertaking this task, the Institute seeks to achieve the following objectives:
In recent years, the above goals have been extended to cater for the research and training needs of countries outside Malaysia as well.
The Malaysian Institute of Economic Research (MIER) is an independent, non-profit organisation devoted to economic, financial and business research that serves as a think-tank for the government and the private sector. It was first mooted in the Prime Minister’s Economic Panel and later promoted by the Council on Malaysian Invisible Trade (COMIT). It was incorporated as a company limited by guarantee on 30 December 1985 and began operations on 2 January 1986.
The research activities of the Institute are organised into four research divisions, namely, Macroeconomic Surveillance and Forecasting, Policy Studies, Industry Studies and Area Studies (see Chart). The research projects undertaken by the Institute are mainly applied and policy-oriented in nature.
The Institute is governed by a Board of Trustees, which sets its policy directions. An Advisory Panel provides guidance to the Institute in the planning of its research activities. The Executive Director is the chief executive officer, supported by a team of full-time research and support staff members. The Institute also engages a number of associate research fellows and consultants, in addition to hosting interns, both local and foreign.

It was only after World War II, when social problems of displacement, juvenile delinquency and poverty became more prominent, that a Department of Social Welfare was formerly established in 1946. Social work services were introduced in terms of financial aid for the needy, probation programs for juvenile delinquents, protection homes for women and girls, and residential care for the disabled and the aged.
The first specialisation in social work began in the early 1950s with British expatriates posted to local government hospitals as ‘Almoners’ until local trained social workers replaced them following the end of British administration. A second specialisation was in probation work with juvenile delinquents, where welfare officers were sent overseas for special training.
The British Almoners had formed the first professional body for social workers, the Malayan Association of Almoners (MAA) in 1955. In the late 1960s it was re-named the Malaysian Association of Medical Social Workers (MAMSW) which successfully fought for a professional scheme of service within the civil service. In the early 1970s, medical social workers thought it was necessary to establish a national body to include their peers from social welfare,prisons and social work education programmes.The Malaysian Association of Social Workers (MASW)was thus formed on the 3rd of March 1973, and registered with the Registrar of Societies on the 28th March 1974 (ROS 1387 Selangor), while the MAMSW was dissolved on the 16th of May 1975.
MASW is registered as an affiliate member of the International Federation of Social Workers (IFSW) since July 1974, and with the Malaysian Professional Centre (BIM) since July 1975. It ia also an Associate Member of the Commonwealth Organisation of Social Workers since 1993, and has a representative on the IFSW- Asia Pacific Executive Committee as Publications Secretary. Its members are also actively involved with the Asia Pacific Association of Social Work Educators and the International Association of Schools of Social Work.

They are starting to come out and reclaim the basic rights that they have lost over the years. They are now waking up and demanding meaningful change: more democratic space, greater accountability, respect for human rights.
Who are we
Aliran identifies with this natural quest for justice in all aspects of public life. Indeed, that has been the core of our struggle since 1977, making us Malaysia’s oldest human rights group. Aliran has had Roster (A1) Consultative Status with the Economic and Social Council of the United Nations since 1987.
Aliran Kesedaran Negara (Malay for National Consciousness Movement) is Malaysia’s first multi-ethnic reform movement dedicated to justice, freedom and solidarity. Listed on the Roster of the Economic and Social Council of the United Nations since 1987, Aliran has a consistent record of championing democratic reforms.

Guided by universal spiritual values, our struggle focuses on building genuine unity by upholding human dignity and promoting social justice for all Malaysians.
Since 1977, we have been planting the seeds of public awareness of critical political, economic and social issues. Over the years, we have lobbied hard for wide-ranging reforms in all aspects of public life. Today, the stirring cries of “Reformasi!” ring out for all to hear.
To conscientise the public, we run this website and publish Aliran Monthly, Malaysia’s leading independent English-language news magazine. With 40 pages of independent articles and in-depth analyses, it is a ‘must read’ for all those concerned about what is really going on in Malaysia.
History
Persatuan Aliran Kesedaran Negara (literally, ‘society for the flow of national consciousness’) was launched in Penang on 12 August 1977 by seven concerned Malaysians from different ethnic backgrounds. Today, we are a national reform movement with members, friends and supporters from different parts of the country. Locating the Aliran office.
What we do

Aliran is the first movement of its kind in the history of our country. We are multi-ethnic in our philosophy, policies, programmes and membership – unlike most movements in the past, which were confined to one community or another.
We have a holistic, comprehensive concept of change which is not bound to any particular time frame. Most movements so far have been concerned with specific issues for short periods of time. (Aliran’s first 25 years)
Besides, Aliran’s struggle for social justice is guided by a universal spiritual world-view which makes it different from other groups whose foundation is either strictly secular or religious in a sectarian sense.
Most of all, Aliran is not involved in electoral competition for power and position. In this way, we hope to preserve and protect our role as a social educator dedicated to the evolution of a new social order.
Our partnerships

Our activities

Aliran work centres on raising public awareness on important issues affecting Malaysians and promoting the quest for a more just soceity. We disseminate our ideas via this website, social media tools, our print publication Aliran Monthly, media releases and e-newsletters.
Occasionally, we organise talks for the public or send our officials as speakers or participants to forums organised by other groups.

Persatuan Kebangsaan Pelajar Islam Malaysia (PKPIM) adalah badan induk pelajar-pelajar Islam Malaysia di peringkat kebangsaan yang berdaftar secara rasmi dengan Pendaftaran Pertubuhan (Pendaftaran 1569 Selangor) pada 27 Jun 1961, dikenali sebagai Persatuan Kebangsaan Pelajar Islam Persekutuan Tanah Melayu dan pada tahun 1963 namanya ditukar seperti yang ada sekarang.
Persatuan Kebangsaan Pelajar-Pelajar Islam Malaysia ditubuhkan pada 31 Mac 1961 bertempat di Asrama Kedua, Universiti Malaya. Penubuhan PKPIM telah diusahakan oleh sekumpulan 10 orang pelajar dari 5 buah institusi pengajian tinggi iaitu Universiti Malaya, Maktab Teknik Kuala Lumpur, Maktab Pertanian Malaya, Kolej Islam Malaya dan Maktab Perguruan Bahasa bertujuan menggabungkan semua persatuan pelajar Islam tanah-air dan menjalankan aktiviti-aktiviti bagi kepentingan pelajar-pelajar Islam di Persekutuan Tanah Melayu.
Matlamat kami
Penubuhannya di bertujuan untuk menjadi wakil pelajar-pelajar Islam Persekutuan Tanah Melayu membuat hubungan di peringkat kebangsaan serta dengan lain-lain persatuan pelajar Islam di luar negara. Manakala kekuatan PKPIM terletak pada iltizam dan komitmen serta kesediaan ahlinya untuk menggerakkan PKPIM dengan konsep dakwah tanpa sebarang kepentingan diri.
Sejak ditubuhkan hinggalah ke saat ini, dasar pergerakan PKPIM tetap berlandaskan kepada Al-Amr bil Ma’ruf dan an-Nahyu a’nil Munkar, selaras dengan tujuan penciptaan manusia sebagai hamba dan khalifah Allah di atas muka bumi.
Perjuangan PKPIM tidak terbatas pada golongan pelajar, tetapi lebih luas termasuk cuba mencari penyelesaian terhadap masalah Ummah dan kepentingan sejagat. Antara sumbangan terpenting PKPIM ialah gagasan penubuhan Universiti Islam Antarabangsa yang pertama di negara ini yang diusahakan dalam Kongres Kemajuan Islam Semenanjung Malaysia yang dianjurkan oleh PKPIM pada tahun 1966.
PKPIM juga menjalinkan jaringan utuh sebagai salah satu badan gabungan Majlis Belia Malaysia (MBM) yang aktif dalam aktiviti pembangunan belia. Malah beberapa tokoh pimpinan PKPIM pernah menjawat jawatan Presiden MBM. Jaringan PKPIM diperluaskan di peringkat antarabangsa di mana turut menjadi badan gabungan aktif dalam Himpunan Belia Islam Sedunia (World Assembly of Muslim Youth-WAMY) dan menjadi anggota gabungan kepada Persekutuan Pelajar-Pelajar Islam Antarabangsa (International Islamic Federation of Student Organisation-IIFSO) sejak 1971, dan juga penaja kepada penubuhan Persekutuan Persatuan Mahasiswa Islam Asia Tenggara (PEPIAT).
PKPIM hingga tahun 2011 telah mencapai usia 50 tahun dan masih bergerak aktif dengan rangkaian yang cukup meluas dengan wujudnya badan gabungan PKPIM hampir setiap negeri dan kampus. Malah kerangka perjuangan PKPIM bukan sekadar disini namun meliputi jemaah yang lebih luas dengan kewujudan ABIM yang kini telah mencapai usia 40 tahun dan WADAH yang terdiri dari senior-senior PKPIM dan ABIM.

It was founded more than a century ago by Bahá’u’lláh (1817-1892) in Persia. Its worldwide community now covers at least 250 countries and independent territories with over 6 million believers.
The Faith’s global scope is mirrored in the composition of its membership. Representing a cross section of humanity, Bahá’ís come from virtually every nation, ethnic group, culture, profession and social or economic class. More than 2,100 different ethnic and tribal groups are represented, and the Bahá’í literature is translated into more than 800 languages. Free from schism or factions, the Bahá’í community forms a single most diverse and widespread organized body of people on earth.
The essential message of Bahá’u’lláh is that of unity. He taught that there is only one God, that there is only one human race, and that all the world’s religions have been stages in the revelation of God’s will and purpose for humanity. As foretold in all of the world’s religious scriptures, the time has arrived for the uniting of all peoples into a peaceful and integrated global society: “the earth is but one country, and mankind its citizens”, Bahá’u’lláh wrote in 1853 when He proclaimed His message as the most recent in the succession of Divine Messengers after Abraham, Krishna, Moses, Zoroaster. Buddha, Christ and Muhammad, “This is the Day in which God’s most excellent favours have been poured out upon men, the Day in which His most mighty grace hath been infused into all created things.”
Not a sect, an independent religion – In the past, the mistaken assumption was that the Bahá’í Faith was a sect of Islam, owing to the fact that its Prophet and early followers emerged from an Islamic society in Persia. Today religious specialists recognize that such an assumption would be equivalent to calling Christianity a ‘sect’ of Judaism, or Buddhism as a ‘denomination’ of Hinduism. Although Christ was indeed Jewish and Buddha was of Hindu background, Their religious messages were not merely re-interpretations of the previous religions, but went far beyond them.",externalaffairs@bahai.org.my,Bahá’í Community Of Malaysia,http://www.bahai.org.my/,,

For more than 44 years PERTIWI has played a vital role in providing various forms of assistance. This has included lobbying for women’s rights in Malaysia, educating, nurturing and empowering women, while maintaining their traditional family role. Some of PERTIWI’s social missions and welfare activities include the provision of literacy skills and education awareness seminars, provision of medical aid to remote villages, sponsorships for educating foster children, and the provision of skills training for single mothers, among other programmes. PERTIWI’s activities are run by a central committee and by groups of volunteers from all walks of society.
To help extend its reach into the community, PERTIWI commenced its mobile soup kitchen project in March 2010 to provide free meals to the homeless and hardcore poor people in Kuala Lumpur’s inner city four nights each week.
Soup kitchens can be found in many of the world’s cities. They exist to provide basic meals to those who go hungry, not because they are lazy or are looking for handouts, but because they simply cannot get enough food or proper nutrition. Those in need may include children, parents and the elderly. Malaysia’s economic success and prosperity has ensured that hunger is not a matter of not having any food at all, but whether those in need are getting enough food on a regular basis and whether we care enough to provide food to them.
Soup kitchens provide an important way to give back to the community by offering a healthy meal to those who are in need. The few soup kitchens that do operate in Kuala Lumpur are already providing this critical service but there are still too many homeless and hardcore poor people in our city who are unable to eat properly on a daily basis.
The PERTIWI Soup Kitchen project provides a humanitarian food-aid service to the hardcore poor irrespective of race or religion. By interacting with various destitute inner city communities on a regular basis, additional support programmes have been introduced to address the needs of the people we serve, such as our medical services for the needy.
The areas we serve are Chow Kit, Kota Raya, Masjid India, Masjid Negara and Syed Putra. Between 500-700 food packets may be served at three or more locations, depending on the number of people lining up for food.
PERTIWI volunteers, in association with other volunteer groups, individuals, college and university students, employees of corporate organizations, have come together to make the PERTIWI Soup Kitchen a warm and caring community outreach project where we get to see volunteers from all races and religions, working together with so much care, reaching out to the homeless and hardcore poor.

YAYASAN GENERASI GEMILANG (GG) is a not-for-profit welfare organisation that sets out to raise an exemplary next-generation and build stronger families. Our key focus areas are mentoring the next generation with leadership and life skills, equipping parents and youth to face cyber-related issues, and community development for marginalized communities in Malaysia.
Love is the heartbeat of Generasi Gemilang. For us, to serve is to see love in action. And this is the operating philosophy underlying our different services. With a passionate and professional team, we are committed to serve our clients, which are the children, the youth, families, and the community as a whole.
Governed by a Board of Directors, we are based in Klang Valley and conduct our programmes throughout Malaysia. With projects that started back in October 2008, we received our official registration as a welfare society on 5 March 2010. In the short span of our existence, over 10,000 clients have already been impacted through our services.
Our services
Counselling & Care is a new service we have added to provide support for teenagers, young adults, couples, parents and families.
Issues may range from relationship disharmony within families to marital conflict, parenting problems, depression, anxiety, problems associated with addiction, work-stress and financial hardship. Counselling may be carried out by professional or para-professional counsellors. Qualified professional counsellors have undergone professional training in both the theory and practice of helping people with problems.
Para-counsellors have completed shorter courses in counselling theory and practice. Call 03-7803 0957 or email care@gengemilang.org to request a Counselling & Care appointment.  Our staff will help you fix an appointment according to our schedule. You may use a pseudonym should you desire privacy. The duration of a typical session is 50-60 minutes at our office.
Family Services
The family unit is important as it helps build up a person’s personality, character and values.  Because of this, we work to inspire and strengthen healthy family life, and restore, reconcile and reconnect relationships within the family unit.  We improve the parent-child relationship into one which is enriching and abounding in love, instil wholesome healthy values and share practical advice that everyone can benefit from.
Kidz Services
How can the fatherless who have never experienced family life know how to model a family of their own? Kidz Services aims to provide hope and opportunities to the fatherless children in orphanages, poor communities and those with special needs.
Cyber Wellness
As the youth are spending increasingly more time online, our sessions will address many issues both parents and the digital generation face such as gaming-addiction, cyber-bullying, the dangers of pornography, and how to respect and maintain one’s privacy in everything from Blogs and emails to Facebook and other forms of social media. Another facet of our programmes is to bridge the digital divide between parents and their children. Parents will then be able to discuss these issues openly and address them accordingly.
The team that addresses these issues come from the digital generation and draws widely from their experiences.

Buddhist Gem Fellowship or commonly known as BGF started in 1980’s to promote the growth of Buddhism and create a better world for all beings. We started as a “Graduate Fellowship” but change the name to “Gem” to look into growing needs of our community.
History
Every year thousands of young Buddhists graduate from universities and colleges, but their talents go untapped. This was a big loss to the Buddhist community. Without new ideas and involvement from graduates, Buddhist societies could only run routine activities that attract a small crowd.
BGF was formed to redress this problem back then. Its purpose was to gather young graduates as well as working professionals for spiritual friendship and enhance their knowledge and skills for Dhamma work. Since then, BGF has grown from strength to strength and embraces all various groups. Our roots are in the Pali Tradition and we are non-sectarian in our approach.
We started in a single storey house in Damansara Utama, Petaling Jaya and moved 4 times till our current location in Section 17 (bordering SS2, Petaling Jaya). We have been in our current premise for 11 years.
Our mission and programmes
BGF plays a pivotal role to bring about the “Transformation of the Malaysian Buddhist community”. Our motto is “Growing People, Inspiring the Future”. For over a quarter century, BGF has been nurturing Buddhist leaders. It organises many programs with impact on Buddhist communities within the country as well as internationally. BGF also organises camps for undergraduates, trains leaders to speak effectively in public, runs courses on counselling skills, and conducts training courses for Dhamma speakers. It runs weekly meditation sessions and organizes talks and public forums by local and international Dhamma speakers. Its innovative programs and approaches are adopted by other groups within as well as outside the country. Many of its early members had pioneered the formation of other Buddhist societies in the country.
Our vision
We plan to transform the Malaysian Buddhist community through our “Eight Areas of Focus”. They are:
i) Buddhist Education
ii) Counselling Services
iii) Creative and Performing Arts
iv) Dhamma Propagation
v) Research and Publication
vi) Spiritual Development
vii) Training and Leadership
viii) Youth Development",info@bgf.org.my,Buddhist Gem Fellowship,http://www.facebook.com/bgf.org.my,,

Who are we
Habitat For Humanity Malaysia is the Malaysian national affiliate of Habitat for Humanity International (HFHI), an international non-governmental organisation that repairs and builds homes with families in need. Habitat for Humanity partners with families from all backgrounds, ethnic groups, and religions to help build simple, decent, safe and affordable homes. Since its founding in 1976, HFHI has helped more than 4 million people construct, rehabilitate or preserve more than 800,000 homes. Approximately 200,000 of these families are in the Asia-Pacific region, where Habitat has been active since 1983. In Malaysia, we have a National Office/Resource Centre in Kuala Lumpur and local affiliates in Kota Kinabalu and Kuching. Together, we have built 211 homes to date.
Our work
Habitat for Humanity Malaysia is not a handout but a “hand-up” program. Selection of ‘home-partner’ families is based on the following three criteria:-
1. Need: Habitat For Humanity Malaysia builds homes for families who are truly in need of better housing. This may vary from a new roof to a brand new home and our staff will survey the home and provide a construction assessment.
2. Commitment to invest “sweat equity”: Habitat For Humanity Malaysia believes that when a family helps build their home, they increase their pride of ownership and foster the development of positive relationships within a community.
3. Willingness to repay the costs of the house: Habitat For Humanity Malaysia partners with families that repay the cost of the materials and labour. Habitat staff provides more than just a home. Community financial education classes are provided in order to increase financial literacy and to help families determine how much they can afford to pay monthly for housing. The no profit, no interest loan term is up to seven years. Furthermore, Habitat places these payments into a revolving fund to help build homes for other families in need.
Habitat for Humanity Malaysia keeps costs down through the use of volunteer labour and the acquisition of financial and in-kind donations. Additional “muscle” for construction comes from volunteer groups that give their time. Volunteers hail from business corporations, civic groups, religious groups, universities and schools, among others. Partner organisations contribute expertise and/or financial resources, and often volunteer labour to strengthen the impact of Habitat’s programs. Other groups, particularly non-governmental organisations and government-linked bodies, contribute services and facilities that Habitat partner families need to live fully transformed lives in thriving and secure communities.
If you know a family or a community in need, are interested in partnering, please contact our National Office on +603-2070 4254 or via info@hfhmalaysia.org.

The aim of the project was to promote wise-use of Kuala Gula through empowering the local community with environmental awareness and skills required to conduct sustainable tourism operations.
KALAM offers various eco-tourism packages (conducted in Malay language). Visitors will be able to explore the wetlands with trained tour guides and experience the authentic fisherman’s lifestyle.

The Sabah Foundation, today operationally referred to as the Yayasan Sabah Group was established through Enactment No. 8 of the Sabah State Legislative Assembly in 1966. The man behind the establishment of Sabah Foundation was the Father of Independence of Sabah, the late Tun Datu Haji Mustapha bin Datu Harun, whose vision was to promote a Malaysian consciousness among the people of Sabah.
The objectives of the foundation are providing education and educational facilities for all Malaysians in Sabah; creating opportunities for a more equitable distribution of economic wealth among the people in Sabah; and providing aids to charitable institutions and victims of natural disasters.
Over the years, the Group has diversified its activities to meet the needs of the day and to keep the forest under its custody in perpetuity. From simply harvesting to downstream processing of timber, the Group ventured into new areas such as agro-plantation, hospitality and tourism, shipping and real estate development in the mid eighties. In the last decade, the Group ventured further away from mainstream forestry into biotechnology and horticulture besides fisheries and food industries.
In the last five years, to meet global demand and an ever challenging business world, the Group has ventured into the oil and gas industry, MICE and information technology.
After more than 48 years in existence, the Group has flourished, achieving its objectives of providing scholarships and loans to needy students as well as students who excelled academically to further their studies locally and abroad.
The Group provided launching grant for the initial MARA Institute of Technology in Sabah at Sembulan, Kota Kinabalu, which now houses its very own Kolej Yayasan Sabah. The Group is also proud to have given a launching grant for Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia Sabah Branch at Limauan, Kinarut. In 1995, the Group built a ‘fast track’ college campus for the temporary use of Universiti Malaysia Sabah at Likas, adjacent to the Menara Tun Mustapha.
With the success in providing education to many graduates, the standard of living of the people improved tremendously. Equal opportunities were created for the people to make a successful living, especially those living in the rural areas of Sabah. Apart from providing education opportunities and educational facilities, the Group carries out Social People Development programmes throughout Sabah through its office in six zones. Through these programmes, in-situ local folks especially housewives, retirees, unemployed youths and single parents are exposed to new methods, through workshops and seminars on how to start small businesses.
Being an advocator of conservation, the Group has set aside four conservation areas namely the Danum Valley (43,800 hectares), Maliau Basin (58,840 hectares), Imbak Canyon (30,000 hectares) and Tumunong Hallu (171 hectares).
In the Southeast Asian region, the Group has established itself as a pioneer in good forest management, leader in conservation efforts, and rehabilitation of logged-over-forest. It is also successful in agro-plantation, especially oil palm, and known worldwide for its biotechnology exports of tissue culture of superior quality teak.
From a humble beginning in forestry, the Group has jumped by leaps and bounds into the global business arena and continues to compete with the best.

Leadership is what makes nations, organisation and communities great. Lack of leadership destroys and diminishes societies. Our goal is to enable every single person to fulfil their potential as the leader they were meant to me be.  Everyone can learn to be a leader. We dream of bringing leadership development to the remotest parts of developing nations, ensuring that everyone who aspires to be a leader, is provided the tools, practice and processes to enable them to “building communities of love”.  We invest deeply into helping poor, underprivileged individuals and communities have this access. We believe if we “teach them how to fish” (become a leader), they will go on to “transform their community and nation”. Enabling one individual to become a leader could have a monumental effect on the organisation or community they live and work in. We are an organisation on a mission.  And we know that we will never accomplish our vision alone and so look forward to partnering with you to transforming your nation, community or organisation.  Join us in this journey of growing people into leaders.
We believe that it is crucial to:
Set new goals to challenge, bond and propel all people to develop into leaders, irrespective of racial, regional or social background in all fields of endeavour
Play an active role in helping the world’s leaders – of all ages, classes and ethnicity – to adapt and meet dramatic changes in our natural and synthetic environments and to help them grow and develop as leaders
Establish Leadership – in all its forms – transforming the minds and hearts of leaders to create a just, free and caring society
Aim for Leadership and development all across the nations and across all ages
Our vision is to seek to grow people into leaders, build affectionate communities, and transform human societies. This vision is anchored by the Golden Rule that we can only prosper if we protect the prosperity of those around us. As members of one vast community, we want to play our role as agents of transformation by creating, redeeming and sustaining life in all spheres of the global society. Our vision is centred on helping everyone build their leadership capabilities and helping them grow into community leaders that make a difference in the world. We strongly believe that leadership will help transform communities and societies into a better, fairer and more caring society.
At Leaderonomics, we are acutely aware that such goals and aims cannot be done alone. In reality, we are nothing. It is only by good fortune, mutual encouragement and communal execution that we can carry the hope that one day we will see the fruition of what we envision.
And if not us, then we hope that the generations after us will reap those fruits. But we aim to partner with you and your organisations to help us along this journey to make this vision a reality.

We are NOT a charity. We are a business that uses 100% of our profits to do more social good. That means no big fat bonuses, no obscene salaries and no dividend payouts to our investors. We exist purely to pursue and fulfil our social mission!
We envision a world where everyone is actively involved in reducing poverty. We’ve made it our mission to end poverty by empowering everyday people to fund and implement poverty alleviation projects through crowd fundraising and impact focused volunteering.
Here’s how it works
MAD raises funds for a social project (E.g., Water Filters)
All funds are transferred directly to our implementing partner’s bank account
Our partner then pays us 10% of the total funds raised
*MAD is paid AFTER we have raised funds for our implementing partners and there is NO upfront costs.

Non-profits usually allocate an annual fundraising budget to raise money for their projects. This budget is spent on fundraising activities you’re probably very familiar with. They throw gala dinners, organise charity marathons and very often spend money on promo booths at shopping malls.
These activities cost money. Actually… they cost a LOT of money! Some non-profits spend up to 40% of their annual budget on fundraising. Needless to say, it’s not the most cost efficient way of doing things. And the problem is, nonprofits have to spend money before they raise money. This forces them to incur unnecessary risk.
MAD flips this situation around by first capping fundraising fees at 10% thereby helping non-profits keep their fundraising cost really low. MAD then helps the situation further by only charging non-profits the 10% AFTER we’ve raised the funds for them. This essentially eliminates any risk the non-profit traditionally adopts when they fundraise.
That’s why our non-profit partners love us!

It was founded in the state of Perak in 1985 as a research, education and consumer and human rights advocacy group and subsequently expanded into a national organisation, now based in Kuala Lumpur.
ERA Consumer’s early success was getting the national Consumer Protection Act passed. However our evolving work in this area, and our increasing capabilities to train and conduct community trainings, naturally led ERA Consumer to an expanded portfolio of programs. This includes sustained human rights education programs.
ERA Consumer is the only organisation in the country to have translated various United Nations (UN) instruments on human rights into the national language, Bahasa Malaysia or the Malay language. These documents have been disseminated to all the public libraries in the country, the libraries of colleges and universities, foreign diplomatic missions, to a number of foreign NGOs and to the resource centres of local political parties so that they have access to these documents in the language that is most widely used in Malaysia.
In 1999, together with the Canadian Human Rights Foundation, ERA Consumer organised a workshop on a training program for NGOs in supporting the investigative functions of the SUHAKAM. The following year, soon after Parliament passed an Act to establish SUHAKAM, we organised a workshop involving NGO’s on “Understanding the HRC Act”.   Subsequently, ERA has held National Consultations annually to assess the performance of SUHAKAM.
For the year 2003, ERA has continued with its efforts to educate the public on human rights. Continuous human rights training programs targeting women and youth have been conducted all over the country. To date ERA have trained 8,000 members of the public on human rights since 1998.  Many of whom are members of political parties that we are certain will share the information that been provided to them with the other members of their party. Besides that ERA has also organised further training for participants paying emphasis on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. Training programs are ongoing projects for ERA and it is conducted throughout the year.
Besides education and awareness programs, ERA is also involved in grass root level community projects. We at ERA recognise the need to empower community members of the ethnic minority. We have been selected by the European Union to carry out the setting up of community centres to empower and educate the Indian community in the rural areas. In the course of this project, we have built linkages with community leaders, the grass root community members as well as lesser-known NGO’s.
ERA Consumer is also a member of the Working Group for the ASIAN Human Rights Mechanism. This Working Group is an informal coalition of individuals and groups within the ASIAN region who are working with government institutions and NGOs in the field of human rights. The Working Group’s primary objective is the establishment of an inter-governmental human rights mechanism in Southeast Asia.
On an International level, ERA Consumer is a member of Forum Asia. ERA also works with the Canadian Human Rights Foundation and AsiaDHRRA (Development of Human Resources in Rural Areas, a coalition of South and East Asian NGOs working in the area of farmer’s rights), Consumer International, South East Asian Council for Food Security and Fair Trade, on food security and trade issues at a regional level.
In the area of standards, ERA Consumer acts as the consumer watchdog on the government panel working on the adoption of standards set by the International Standards Organisation. On Consumer protection issues, ERA Consumer collaborates with the Federation of Malaysian Consumer Association (FOMCA), the Ministry of Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs and the Regional Office of the United Nations Development Program on environmental issues.

We are a collective of social entrepreneurs with a mission is to raise  awareness about the urban waste problem in Kuala Lumpur. We do this by making products, builds and installations from upcycled materials that are usually considered waste.From design to production or construction, we turn your ideas into reality.

At Biji-Biji, We love making things. We have our own workshop where we like to create useful and interesting products from start to finish. Conceptualization, Design, Prototype Development and Production, we do it all. We believe it is empowering to have knowledge of the entire production process. This means we can easily spot areas for improvement and it also means we are not too dependent on third parties. And the possibilities are limitless!
Every member in our team has experience, interest, admiration or expert knowledge in some area of green technology. The rapid advancements in the field mean that green technology will soon be available to everybody. The only challenge is to make simple yet highly effective or efficient use of it. So that is what we are exploring.
We also believed that everybody can do something, that is the simple truth. We try to broaden the horizon of people’s understanding of what type of people or what type of skills are useful. We will work with anybody who has good intentions, and we are confident it will be worth everybody’s while.

Elevyn (pronounced as “eleven”) aims to create wealth using fair trade online stores, and to provide an innovative platform to raise money for social causes. We focus on a double bottom line strategy, and use 2 indicators for our performance: Social Return on Investment (SROI) and Return on Investment (ROI)
The idea is simple – we want to encourage marginalized communities to improve their livelihoods by providing them access to a worldwide market via the Internet.

We do that by building a web-based platform that connects community-based sellers to a socially-conscious market. These online stores can be set up and managed by the communities themselves, and Elevyn works closely with NGOs and field partners on training, consultancy and advisory.
A portion of sales made through the online store will fund specific Causes that support the local communities – “Raise $100 to buy books for the school”, for example.
Elevyn also intends to empower communities. In existing cases, it is known that some craft makers only pocket less than 10% of its final sales price in the market. This is a situation that Elevyn can change – and we foresee that more than 75% of the item`s sales price can go back to the producers.

EduNation is a volunteer driven non-profit educational initiative and we are here to ensure that every Malaysian student has all the educational resources he needs to succeed academically in school.
It’s been a wild ride full of challenges, roadblocks and steep hills. But we’re finally here and up and running at long last. For the past year we have been hard at work in putting the Malaysian school syllabus online by mapping the Khan Academy videos and creating our own videos. Our work is in constant progress and will continue to be in progress for many years to come.
Our mission is to provide a complete educational resource for every Malaysian primary and secondary school student. These include:
Learning Videos:
In the next 2 years we are focused on creating learning videos in maths, science, physics, chemistry, accounts, economics and languages for Malaysian public school students. We are also Khan Academy’s advocate here in Malaysia and we are mapping and translating all videos to the Malaysian syllabus.
Practice Problems and Test Papers:
The basic beta test paper platform for maths is out on September 2012 so SPM students would be better prepared for SPM maths this year. The practice problem platform will be ready in 2013 and this platform allows you to practice your understanding of key concepts.
Social Media Platform:
What if you can get free tutoring help, powered by the Malaysian community? If you’re like one of the many Malaysians students who need academic help, then stay tuned. In 2013 you will be able to get online help when you need it and you will be able to give out help to those who need it. It will all be contained in a social media platform specifically designed for education.
We are well on our way to accomplishing our mission. Why not join us in this crazy, unrealistic mission (or so they say) to revolutionise the way Malaysians learn?

Hospitals Beyond Boundaries (HBB) is a non-profit registered under the Malaysian Societies Act (Society No: PPM-019-14-22052012). We are made of youth professionals from various disciplines united by a mission to build hospitals where it is needed most. Driven by a strong belief that the sickness of the poor is not only a call to generous short term relief action, but also a demand to rebuild a society through long term and sustainable health care efforts, HBB was born.
Mission
Our mission is to help build hospitals where it is needed most. We develop the surrounding community socially and economically by empowering them to sustain the health care services we provide. We look at health care beyond the hospital boundaries to include adequate shelter, nutrition and health education.
Our Working Model
Empowering the community through social business
Our hospitals will not run on full charity, but on empowerment of the poor through social business. This is because we believe that nobody wants to be permanently dependent on others. People are motivated to know that they have the capability to take care of themselves and other people. Through social business, we provide jobs and economic opportunities for the community. We stand by the ‘Seven Principles of Social Business’ defined by Nobel laureate Professor Muhammad Yunus:
1. Our business objective is to overcome poverty, not to maximize profit
2. Our company will attain financial and economic sustainability
3. Investors get back only their investment amount. No dividend is given beyond the return of original investment
4. When the investment amount is paid back, profit stays with the company for expansion and improvement
5. Our company will be environmentally conscious
6. Our workforce gets market wage with better-than-standard working conditions
7. We do this with joy
In developing countries, the socio-economic gap between the rich and the poor is huge, even in the same locality. A social business can leverage on this situation by cross-subsidizing the poor by providing high quality service for all. For our first project, we are focusing on mother and child’s health. For every 3 children delivered and the services paid for by those who could afford, the profits will be used to subsidize one child delivery for those who could not afford.
Stimulating the local economy 
We empower the community to take charge of their own healthcare by involving the local community as paid community healthcare workers. The work of a community health care worker include educating the community about health, refer patients to the hospital, and visit patients who are unable to come to the hospital. They do not take over the responsibility of doctors or nurses. Instead, as members of their own community, they serve as an important bridge that builds trust and links the hospital to the community. Involving the local community in the treatment of patients would better address the barriers to health faced by the local community such as transportation costs, cultural and religious beliefs, social stigma, discrimination and lack of information. The rationales behind paying the community healthcare workers are: (1) it would create paying jobs for the community and ultimately boosts the local economy (2) payments and increments based on time or performance reduces workforce turnover and the costs of finding replacements (3) by releasing their minds of financial worries to take care of their family, they could focus on their work and perform their jobs at their best. At HBB, we have respect for people’s labour and we allow them the dignity of having a job and taking care of their family.
Creating a health care system that caters to the needs of the community
The countries that we choose to work in are newly developing. Hence, many public hospitals face impediments such as limited resources, bureaucratic delays or poor healthcare system. With so many things to improve on, they may not have enough resources to cater each hospital towards the unique needs of the surrounding community. By being a community-run hospital, we wish to be different by tailoring ourselves to the cultural needs and socio-economic condition of the community. Through the freedom to collaborate with other organizations, corporations, local partners and donors, we provide more flexible control of the management, workforce and medical supplies in our hospitals.

EPIC (Extraordinary People Impacting Community) is a social enterprise that aims to inspire, mobilise and empower people to make positive impact in their communities. EPIC designs and creates collaborative platforms that allow you to do this in a fun and easy way.
It’s flagship project, EPIC Homes, is an initiative that aims to build relationships through the act of building homes for underprivileged Malaysian communities. An EPIC Home can be built within three days with a team of ordinary people. Under the Builder Training Programme, participants are equipped with the skills and knowledge to lead, manage and build homes.
To date, they have built over 18 homes with over 400 people from around the world, and have grown into a community with over 4,400 people. They have also built with corporations such as PEMANDU, Media Prima Berhad, GE Malaysia, AirAsia Berhad, Taylor’s Education Group & Sinclair Knight-Merz. This year, EPIC intends to build 100 homes whilst transforming this initiative into a nationwide movement.
Our History
EPIC started as a conversation over the dinner table in 2010, where four friends were discussing the possibility of solving local issues through community work. When the conversation ended, we realized they had done a whole lot of talking, but no work.
And so, we began to search through friends and families for small projects that could bring likeminded people together with the intention to bring about positive impact and to drive change in their community. A man from a nearby village in Batang Kali told us of a potential house-painting project and took us to recce the site.
When we arrived, a little boy in the group asked, “Where is the toilet?” It turns out that the village toilets weren’t completed, and thus the settlement didn’t have any. And that “toilet-building and painting project” (that really was the title of the project) was the first ever EPIC event.
We thought that we’d only be able to gather a tiny group of people for the project, but after blasting our call for volunteers through social media we were hit with 64 committed individuals who were ready for action. These guys ranged from ages 13-60 and they hailed from different countries around the world. When these strangers met for the first time at the project, we immediately knew that we had something special. We had never experienced such authenticity before. Each person that was present had one goal in mind: they were there to do whatever they could to help another person. This inspired us and showed us that by doing little with many, we could produce impact of epic proportions.
What We Do
EPIC Homes aims to build relationships between the urban and rural divide through the activity of building homes for underprivileged Malaysian communities, currently focusing on the indigenous people of Peninsular Malaysia, the Orang Asli.
We believe that the presence of relationships is what truly differentiates a ‘Home’ from a House’. When an EPIC Home is built, a family does not just get a new house, they become connected to a larger community who genuinely cares for them, a community that seeks to understand their challenges, and who seeks to solve it together with them.
Without people and relationships a house is nothing but a shell. This shell may protect a family from physical elements, but it is through people that they will be inspired and motivated to improve and move forward.
Since encountering our first dilapidated house in 2010, we have built 17 homes mostly in Selangor and Perak, connecting Orang Asli families with over 300 people from around the world. We have built alongside Malaysians and have also had builders from Hong Kong, Australia, Germany, Japan, Holland, New Zealand, India, Sweden, Korea, Turkey, UK, Singapore, Philippines, Indonesia, Taiwan, South Africa, USA, Iraq and Venezuela.

336,,Social Enterprise,,,"QuickCauses.com is a project level accounting system that helps Cause owners and Donors keep track of publicly sourced funding towards Causes. The nature of the Causes can be anything under the sun from whimsical fund raising efforts to get your favourite school teacher a gift, or perhaps organise a high school reunion party with old friends and their families, or perhaps a drinking club for a pub crawl night. We leave the creativity of the Cause to you!
The Public’s Right to Information
On the more serious note, we would like QuickCauses to be used to raise funds for relief towards genuine tragedy due to conflict, natural disasters, famine and the other nastiness in our world today. We believe that the way public donations are being managed today, in its opaque nature is extremely open to abuse. How much money have we all donated to various charities and towards relief efforts everywhere and what do we know of how this money is spent and how much was actually collected? We the public donors are the stakeholders of any public funds and we have a right to know exactly how this money is spent and how much goes where.
Manage and Report
To this end, QuickCauses was birthed to provide a means where public donations towards any Cause can be raised in a transparent manner where all donations can be scrutinised and all expenditure from a Cause be reported visibly for all public viewing. Our automatic email notification alerts Cause Owners and Donors on changes and updates to the Cause and provides a report at the end of the Cause to all Donors outlining how their money has been spent.
Monitoring
While making it easy to manage Causes, QuickCauses itself does not handle any transaction of cash or goods. We are a management tool that enables the transparent monitoring and reporting of Donations towards Causes but the responsibility of each Cause is left to the Cause owner. As all Causes are public documents, we can decide to freeze Causes or even ban Users that are deemed suspect and will cooperate with authorities if certain Causes are not providing honest response and reporting. We urge the public to contact us immediately if there are discrepancies for us to investigate and take action. QuickCauses is about transparency and our responsibilities are primarily to the public.
Support Us
We hope that you will use QuickCauses to raise funds. We appreciate feedback and we will continue to develop more features in the time to come. If you agree with our struggle and our Cause, please support us by pledging some money to us.

339,Sentul Park Jalan Strachan (off Jalan Ipoh) 51100 Kuala Lumpur.,Social Enterprise,+603 4047 9000,Dato' Faridah Merican,"Who are we
In May 2004 three organisations – Yayasan Budi Penyayang Malaysia, YTL Corporation Berhad and The Actors Studio Malaysia – set out to build a common platform to develop the performing arts in Malaysia.That platform is the Kuala Lumpur Performing Arts Centre (klpac), or PentasSeni KL.
klpac is a not-for-profit company dedicated to the practice of traditional and contemporary performing arts, as well as education and community outreach.
While klpac provides a cutting-edge facility to aid the growth and advancement of performing arts practitioners, it is the essence of community that fuels its vision.
Diverse, innovative performances cater to a broad spectrum of artists and audiences while outreach programmes seek to develop public participation in all aspects of the performing arts regardless of race, class or creed.
Our mission
Central to this participation is access. Our mission is to demonstrate how the arts play a central role in all our lives by helping us shape our understanding of the world, and to express that understanding so that it deepens our experience.
One of the many ways the performing arts can benefit society is by enhancing the quality of our future workforce. They open new horizons and experiences to our young. The creative process, for example, is crucial to solving problems and thinking strategically. Likewise, clear expression is the cornerstone of effective communication and confidence.
Our goal is to show how learning about, and appreciating, the performing arts will enrich our lives and yield concrete, practical benefits in our everyday world.
Our vision

The Klang Valley’s leading presenter of performing arts in Malaysia, nurturing and refining the standards of services practices and production value for the performing arts that is internationally recognised and admired.
Our mission statement

The Kuala Lumpur Performing Arts Centre promotes cultivates and sustains the performing arts for the betterment and enrichments of communities within the Klang Valley and for the Nation.
History
In 1995, two individuals created history by building the first privately owned and operated theatre in Malaysia below Dataran Merdeka. The individuals were none other than Faridah Merican and Joe Hasham. The said theatre was the The Actors Studio@Plaza Putra.
Then in 2003, flash floods inundated KL and destroyed The Actors Studio’s underground complex entirely. It was out of this tragedy that the The Kuala Lumpur Performing Arts Centre (klpac) was born.
The arts community needed a new home. And history was made yet again. The Actors Studio, YTL Corporation and Yayasan Budi Penyayang joined hands to establish the country’s first fully-integrated arts centre. klpac, a non-profit organisation, opened its doors in May 2005.
Four years on, it has not only been a home to the arts community and a foster home for foreign troupes but it has become the very lifeline that keeps the arts and cultural life in Malaysia breathing.
An arts and cultural icon. Historical landmark. Award-winning architectural design.
There is nothing quite like klpac, really.

Every person has a right to food. Food that is safe and nutritious. Food that is adequate, accessible and affordable. Food that is culturally acceptable and produced in sustainable manner.
Food security at the household and national level refers to self reliance and self sufficiency in food production using sustainable food production systems and approaches.
Today, aggressive trade liberalisation of food and agriculture is threatening food security in many parts of the world. Free market policies of governments, financial and multilateral trade institutions have changed the nature of how food is produced and distributed. The rural farmers and fisher folks of South-east Asia who traditionally had the power to decide what they cultivate, how they produce or farm, are currently faced with critical challenges compounded with economic competitiveness with multinational corporations. These challenges have been further worsened by the impact of climate change and the scarcity of natural resources such as land, water, forest and agro-biodiversity. Their market competitiveness has also been undermined by the aggressive marketing strategies of more affluent corporations facilitated by biased and unfair policies, favouring those with monetary and economic power.
Driven by large agro-food corporations which prioritize profits over local self-sufficiency, agriculture is increasingly unsustainable. Trade is free but not fair. Fair trade centrally allows the food producers to earn a decent livelihood without resorting to unethical means or plundering the soil and at the same time is acceptable by the consumer, supported by an efficient marketing system that will ensure the environment and socio-economic concerns are adhere to.
The result? Degraded environments. Destruction of rural livelihoods and endangered food security.
Who are we
The South-east Asian Council for Food Security and Fair Trade (SEACON) was informally established in 1996 with a primary objective of providing a coordinated approach and an integrated initiative to address food security, agriculture and trade issues. In each of the member country, SEACON provides support to its partners through people-centered mechanisms that enable government, private sector and civil society representatives to meet and dialog on agriculture, food and trade issues.
The partnership with the national networks is to ensure participatory positions and analysis to be brought forth at the regional level, through a secured backing from the grassroots. SEACON’s role is thus to:
Monitor and keep in check the adverse effects of free trade
Monitor the development of relevant economic and social domestic policies in the region
Offer alternative agro-trade strategies based on the principles of fair trade and food security
Improve and lobby for policies related to food, agriculture and trade at regional and international levels
How SEACON Began
Before the World Food Summit and NGO Forum in Rome, Italy in November 1996, a conference was held in Manila to discuss the impact of trade liberalization and economic deregulation on food security and people’s livelihoods. From this, emerged the Balay Declaration, a document containing the collective aspirations and vision of NGOs for food security in this region. SEACON has since become the mechanism and platform to translate the spirit and objectives of this Declaration into reality.
The Balay Declaration calls on governments of South-east Asia to respect, protect and fulfil the right of their citizens to food, and to make food security for all the cornerstone of their economic policy. It demands that:
Governments provide adequate food supply through national and regional food self-sufficiency efforts
International institutions such as the WTO, APEC, WB, IMF acknowledge the inherent right of all countries to food security
Governments recognize the vital role of small farmers, fisher folk and women in ensuring food security, and see that these sectors have access to and control of resources
Governments guarantee long term food security through the adoption of sustainable agriculture, equitable access to resources, and improved governance
What SEACON Does
Participatory Research
Through research we aim to build an understanding of how global politics impacts on food security and to strengthen capability building initiatives. SEACON has initiated various research undertakings, including:
Rice trade in South-east Asia
Rice is the main staple food in this region. Its production and distribution are central in ensuring freedom from hunger. These issues are explored in our present “Food Security and Markets in South-east Asia: State and private sector interaction in rice trade”. Our findings will form the basis of policies forwarded to national and regional bodies to promote the development of sustainable and dynamic producing sectors.
The food crisis in Indonesia
In 1999, SEACON organized a fact-finding mission to Indonesia to investigate claims of a food emergency. The mission, comprising experts and activist in the field of food security, discovered that this was due to the ineffective development policies of the government. A food crisis had been manufactured for political reasons. Instead of food aid, Indonesia was in need of an economic recovery that would provide employment for the people in order to have the purchasing power to buy food that was produced locally, to support the rural farmers in Indonesia.
Women and food security
Women’s role in ensuring food security is often ignored and undervalued. SEACON’s report, entitled “No Shortcut to Food Security: From A Women’s Perspective”, was published to correct this distortion. It shows how women are connected to the production and distribution of food. It also identifies the obstacles they face, including gender-biased policies. Based on secondary data from Malaysia, Philippines, Thailand and Laos, the recommendations of this study have been compiled into a regional policy networking paper.
The Impact of Trade Liberalization on Small Scale Producers in South East Asia
This Report was timely released in 2005 to address the socio-economic impact of the ASEAN Free Trade Area Agreement. The report was jointly researched and produced by SEACON member-partners from Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Philippines, Thailand and Vietnam.
Advocacy
SEACON carries out advocacy at many levels, from lobbying national governments and regional institutions, to working directly with civil society actors in food security and fair trade matters. Our past projects include the WTO-Agreement on Agriculture Campaign and a conference in 1999 titled “People’s Response to the Food Security Crisis in South-east Asia” in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. SEACON has also held national meetings to popularize the Balay Declaration, and actively taken part in other gatherings where we have contributed to the debates on food security and fair trade.
The World Trade Organisation Agreement on Agriculture Campaign
The WTO Agreement on Agriculture aims to liberalize agricultural trade. However, it is heavily biased and unequally distributes benefits between the world’s players. Typically, rural and small farmers and local livelihoods in developing nations have been marginalized, thus jeopardizing food security in these countries. Through education workshops with NGOs and government officials. Campaigns were also organized to highlight the impacts.
Networking
SEACON facilitates processes whereby non government and people’s organizations can share and learn from one another. Through these processes, SEACON encourage joint actions to influence national and regional policies impacting on food security. In this manner, SEACON champions people-centred development, i.e the meaningful participation of people in development.", annie@uwalumni.com | seacon@seacouncil.org | annie@seacouncil.org ,South East Asian Council For Food Security And Fair Trade (SEACON),http://www.seacouncil.org,,

It was initiated by a group of women and men who were particularly concerned about the increasing incidence of violence against women and children in our society.
Working with other NGOs in the country, SAWO launched the Campaign against Violence against women in September, 1986 with a two-day public workshop cum exhibition and has since, continued to work and lobby for better protection and assistance for women and children.
Our objectives
The overall objective of SAWO is to work towards making our society more equal and just particularly for women and children. To achieve this, SAWO undertakes activities to raise public awareness and to advocate for positive changes to laws and policies that affect women.

Box 3052 47590 Subang Jaya Malaysia,Social Enterprise,+6013-3508058,Colin Nicholas,"Over the years, we have had an increasing number of individuals approaching us for information on the Orang Asli. Most of these requests were for basic information and data on the peoples; at other times, for more complicated matters or for contacts and introductions to Orang Asli communities or individuals.
The growing frequency of these requests dug more and more into our time and energy. We helped wherever we could, especially since we were promised copies of their theses, reports, assignments, articles or whatever outputs they were working on. While some did keep their promise, the majority, sadly, did not — even with our prompting and reminding.
Even more disappointing was that some of these individuals acted in ways detrimental to the Orang Asli, or ourselves, or were just plain self-serving. You can get a sense of what we mean in the articles Jumping to Conclusions and Time to Reciprocate.
Also, while we are in no position to say how academics and researchers should go about doing their work, please take a look at (the later part of) Acting on the Knowledge if you want to know what our position is on purely academic pursuits.
On COAC
The Center for Orang Asli Concerns was established in 1989 to advance the cause of the Orang Asli — whether via the greater dissemination of Orang Asli news and views, assisting in court cases involving Orang Asli rights, or in developing arguments for lobbying and advocacy work.
That is to say COAC functions primarily as a center to facilitate Orang Asli initiatives at self-development and in defense of their rights, and to support those who want to promote such initiatives.
The focus is on Orang Asli communities who still want to exercise autonomy and control over their social institutions, their traditional territories and their future, but are unable to do so fully because of factors outside their control.
What COAC is not
COAC is not a membership organisation. And while we are really appreciative each time we receive an unsolicited contribution, COAC does not apply for, nor receive, any form of institutional funding.
Also, COAC was not established to be an information clearing house on the Orang Asli (as many assume we are).
Nevertheless, depending on the nature and purpose of the research, and depending on our resources and capacity at the time, we do try to entertain specific requests from students, researchers and others. But this frequently represents a big strain on our already limited resources and capacity, and we hope you will understand should your queries go unanswered or get attended to late.
But we always make it a point to reciprocate any good work done.
Nevertheless, with this website, we hope to provide sufficient information to answer most of the basic queries we get. The site also aims at providing some insight into current Orang Asli issues and concerns.",colin.coac@gmail.com,Center for Orang Asli Concerns (COAC),http://www.coac.org.my/,,

PACOS TRUST is a community-based organisation (CBO) dedicated towards supporting indigenous communities in Sabah. Although registered under the Trustees Ordinance (Sabah) only in 1997, it has been actively involved with communities since 1987 as a different legal entity. PACOS TRUST sees itself as on organisation that strives to empower indigenous communities through systematic building and strengthening of community organizations, which can act collectively on its own. PACOS TRUST also sees the need to support networking among organisations struggling to assert right over community resources and revitalizing indigenous systems.

PACOS TRUST hopes to have contacts in all 21 rural districts in Sabah with at least one community organization in each district. It also plans to boost its work on Land Rights by planning a 4-year land campaign, continue its effort to ensure active participants in regulating and protecting access to biological diversity and indigenous knowledge, participate and contribute actively in the Malaysia and Asia network, and provide input into development-related issues faced by indigenous communities.
Much of the financial resources of PACOS TRUST are accrued from outside the country but it also raises funds through various activities (such as the research on forest-related knowledge with JOFCA-Japan, hosting international conferences) and contribution in kind by communities and its personnel. Among current major funding partners are the Swedish Society for Nature Conservation (funding land/ resource management projects), DANCED (Pilot project on Wildlife Management in two areas, Community Research and Information), International Work Group for Indigenous Affairs (Land Campaign), and Bernard Van Leer Foundation (Early Child Care and Development).

S. Malar), an Entrepreneurship Consultant, who has worked closely with the women of the war-torn zone in the North-East of Sri Lanka. TECH Malaysia is the ‘youngest’ TECH to be formed. TECH was registered with the Registrar of Companies in Malaysia in 2004. In 2008, Dr. Selvamalar Ayadurai expanded the scope of TECH Outreach to cover not just communities in Sri Lanka but disadvantaged communities in Malaysia and other parts of the world that require socio-economic and technological development. TECH Outreach was formed in 2008 and registered with the Registrar of Societies in May 2009.
TECH Outreach Malaysia functions on the platform to transform, enhance, cultivate and harness the elements imperative to championing the SELF-SUSTAINABILITY pursuit in disadvantaged communities. TECH Outreach Malaysia believes in helping communities tap into their potential and transform themselves through entrepreneurial pro-activeness, risk-taking and innovation. It is within this framework of vision that TECH Outreach has adopted the famous “Grameen Micro-Credit Financing” Model by Professor Muhammad Yunus, in transforming communities.
The Grameen Banking System (GBS) is a Micro-Credit Financing Model which gives loans to women without any collateral or guarantee. It is the brainchild of Professor Muhammad Yunus, the 2006 Nobel Peace Laureate of Bangladesh who recently was awarded the Medal of Freedom by President Barack Obama. It was introduced in 1976 in Bangladesh but today has been replicated in more than 150 countries, including Malaysia. More than 98% of the borrowers are women who borrow the money for income generation projects. Women borrowers form groups of 5 to 10 on a group lending basis and repay the loan on a weekly basis under a closely supervised and established banking system. The GBS has alleviated poverty and lifted more than 68% of the women borrowers above the poverty line. Women under the GBS strictly adhere to the 16 Decisions which is a “way of life” professed under the Grameen Model.

Leonard Cheshire was born in Chester, England on 7th September 1917. He was educated at Stowe School and Merton College, Oxford. Following the outbreak of the 2nd World War he joined the Royal Air Force and became the youngest group Captain at the age of 25. During the war he was chosen the official British observer of the atomic bomb dropped at Nagasaki. He was awarded the Victorian Cross in 1944. After the war he dedicated his life to world peace, the sick and the disabled. He was created a Baron in 1991 but he died on 31st July 1992.
In response to a personal request, the first Leonard Cheshire Service was established in 1948 in Hampshire, UK, by the Founder, the late Group Captain Leonard Cheshire VC. He firmly believed that all disabled people should have the maximum opportunity to determine every aspect of their own lives, which was not a very commonly held view at that time, as opportunities open to a disabled person were limited to whatever care and support could be offered at home or failing this, admission to a hospital ward.
The late Group Captain Leonard Cheshire VC devoted the remainder of his life to expanding these limitations and the everyday life choices of disabled people by establishing services to support them not only in the UK but also across the world.
In 1955, the first international Leonard Cheshire Service was established as a residential Home in Bombay , India. Over the next 51 years, a further 250 Services, providing a wide and diverse range of support programmes for disabled people have been set up in 57 countries worldwide.
Our Vision
A society in which every disabled person can enjoy their right and has the opportunity to fulfill their potential.
Our Mission
To enable disabled people to improve their quality of life and to campaign for the removal of the barriers which hinder them.
Our values
Valuing the Individual – Taking time to listen to each disabled person and to understand what matters to them.
Working together – Finding our success in the achievement of each disabled person with whom we work.
Honesty – Generating trust with each of our stakeholders by being clear about what we can and cannot do and by delivering on our promises.
Creativity – Developing imaginative new products, moving into new fields and seeing new ways of working so that we can serve disabled people more effectively.
Energy – Being ambitious in the goals we set and committing ourselves to their achievement.
NEEDS
Volunteers are welcome. Devote some of your spare time in teaching the residents any hobby or handicraft or help in the daily chores. Most of the residents feel rejected by the community. Do try to bring cheers and inculcate a sense of belonging in them. Contact organisation near you (Selangor, Johor, Penang, Sabah or Sarawak) for more information.
Your donations will be greatly appreciated as the association is a voluntary organization and depends mainly on the public support to carry out its work. Money whatever the amount will go a long way towards helping the residents to be independent. Gifts in kind such as foodstuff, linen, and materials for handicrafts are always welcome.
Donation in cash, please contact respective organisations for more details.

Voice of the Children (VoC) was founded in 2008 to advocate on issues affecting children. VoC recognizes that the welfare and protection of every child in Malaysia can only be realised through the adoption, implementation and enforcement of the Convention of the Rights of the Child in Malaysia. As part of its core mission, VoC advocates for law and policy reform to ensure that every child in Malaysia is protected from all forms of abuse and is no longer at risk of violation.
VoC was established in order to fill a gap in existing children’s services, which traditionally have specialised in caring for children by supplying food, shelter, education and other direct services. By focusing instead on legal and policy issues affecting children, VoC occupies a distinct niche in Malaysia. We aim to be a resource for both service organizations and the legal community by providing information and advocacy on laws, policies, and treaties that impact children.

United Voice is a self-advocacy group for persons with learning disabilities. Its vision is to form a national body for persons with learning disabilities in Malaysia.
Our objectives

United Voice started in 1995 when 3 volunteers recruited a small group of persons with learning disabilities and formed what was then known as the Self Advocacy Group. The group’s name was changed to United Voice in 2000. For 10 years since its inception, United Voice was sponsored by Dignity and Services, an organisation that also advocates for the rights of persons with learning disabilities. However, since 12 July 2005, United Voice was registered as a society and became an independent entity.
At the time of writing, United Voice had a total of 60 members.
Estimated Monthly Expenditure: RM30,000
Our needs

Volunteers needed to support its members in its hand-made greeting cards and bookmark project. Other than that, they often need volunteers to help out with Employment Project, selling products at bazaars, fundraising events, go outings with the residents and other events. They are also looking for volunteers who can teach members Art, basic computer skills, sewing, sports etc. Or the volunteers can help out in office work like Administrative work, general work, updating website, newsletter etc.
United Voice’s monthly operating expenses amount to approximately RM30,000. It has 7 full time staff and 4 part time staff. United Voice is in need of regular funds to cover its monthly expenditure and is also sourcing funds to purchase a van to provide transportation services for its members.
Our Employment Project has a Arts & Craft Studio, Bakery and an Art Gallery. Currently we have 25 members working under the Employment Project.
Cash donations and donations in kind welcomed.

The Mission of the Malaysian Association of the Blind is to empower persons with visual impairment by providing them with services and opportunities for greater participation, involvement, and integration into society, as well as to promote prevention of blindness.
The Malaysian Association for the Blind (MAB) is the premier voluntary organisation in Malaysia serving visually impaired persons. It provides services that help the blind and prevent the tragedy of avoidable blindness.
Established in 1951 by the then Department of Social Welfare to look after the general well-being of blind persons in the country, MAB has since carried out this role and much more. Its activities have extended from Kuala Lumpur to other parts of the country. These include educational programmes, rehabilitation courses, vocational training and placement service. In addition, MAB also runs a Braille library, a “talking” book library, a Braille Publishing Unit, an Information Technology Centre, Resource Centre and a Sale and Production Unit to name a few. Its prevention of blindness programmes are realized through the eye hospital which MAB established in 1986.
In recent years, MAB has reached out to the visually impaired folks in the rural areas where rehabilitation services and training programmes are provided to them within their home environment, through its community-based rehabilitation (CBR) schemes.
The Malaysian Association for the Blind always works towards creating greater public awareness concerning the abilities and capabilities of the visually impaired persons under its charge. This is to ensure their better integration into the society and a better quality of life.
In order to accommodate the changing needs, demands and challenges of the modern world, MAB strives constantly to improve and expand its services for the betterment of visually impaired people by introducing new courses and acquiring new equipment.

The MareCet Research Organisation is a non-profit, non-governmental organisation established in 2012 committed to increasing scientific knowledge, implementing conservation actions, strengthening policies, and generating awareness on marine mammals and the greater marine environment. A brainchild of Dr. Louisa Ponnampalam and Fairul Izmal Jamal Hisne, MareCet is first and only non-profit, non-governmental organisation solely dedicated to the research and conservation of marine mammals in Malaysia.
The name MareCet (pronounced ma-rei-set) is derived from the combination of the words Mare and Cetacean. The word Mare is from the Latin language that carries the meaning, ocean, while Cetacean is the scientific grouping of whales, dolphins and porpoises. By combining the two words into MareCet (with Cet being a shortened form of Cetacean), the name signifies the two main focus of the organisation: (1) The ocean, in general and (2) marine mammals, in particular.
It is envisioned that in the long-term, the Organisation will be a center where various parties are able to study, conduct research, and receive training in various aspects connected to the two main focus areas of the Organisation.

We hope that the audiences will leave feeling that they can be a part of the solution to environmental problems. With a growing public awareness for the environment, the Festival aims to increase this groundswell through inspiring and educational films which hopefully will motivate people to go out and make a difference in their community and around the world. We involve environmental organizations and green businesses through the Green Market, where groups can share opportunities to get involved and promote sustainable consumption and productions.While we will feature national and international films, we also hope to highlight the works of local filmmakers and foster an interest in environmental film making through mentoring and a filmmaking forum. An important component is the opportunity for open discussion related to the films, either with filmmakers or with experts on the film’s topic.

MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT, Nithi Nesadurai
“It is my pleasure to welcome you to the website of EPSM, a small and dynamic group focusing on urban environmental issues and climate change in Malaysia. We feature our work and activities on the environment since we were formed in 1974.”
HISTORY
EPSM was founded at a public meeting held at the University of Malaya in Kuala Lumpur on 11 January 1974 by a group of Malaysians concerned about protecting the environment. It is a membership-based national organization, run by an elected Executive Committee on an entirely voluntary, non-profit basis.
THE FOUNDER
Gurmit Singh was born in Penang, on 3 November 1942. He is prominent student leader in the 1960s and 1970s, Gurmit is former secretary-general of the National Human Rights Society of Malaysia (Hakam). He got into environmental advocacy in 1974, long before caring about the environment became fashionable (though one may argue that, in Malaysia, the environment still isn’t getting the attention it deserves).
Gurmit served the Environmental Protection Society of Malaysia (EPSM) as president for two decades until 1994, but remains an adviser. He is currently chairperson of the Centre for Environment, Technology and Development Malaysia (Cetdem), a non-profit committed to “improving environmental quality through the appropriate use of technology and sustainable development”
RECORD
EPSM has highlighted environmental problems through the mass media, made representation to government agencies, campaigned against polluters, undertaken surveys and studies, and contributed towards environmental education and awareness through talks, forums, seminars and its publication, Alam Sekitar.
Our record of campaigns include the following. Through networking and collaboration with both government and non-government bodies, we have contributed to various successful campaigns focusing on Endau-Rompin, Batu Caves, Tembeling National Park, Papan, Bakun Dam, the Societies Act Amendments and the Environment Impact Assesment. EPSM has also monitored the Environmental Quality Act 1974 and its subsequent regulation.
REPRESENT
In terms of representation, EPSM is currently represented on a wide range of bodies including the Environmental Quality Council, National Habitat Committee, National Steering Committee on Local Agenda 21 and the Construction Industry Development Board’s Technical Committee for best Environmental Practices.

The establishment of APAFRI was prompted by the need to provide a viable institutional framework for research collaboration in the region. Since 1991, the Forestry Research Support Programme for Asia and the Pacific (FORSPA) has been fulfilling the networking function. APAFRI , a follow-up of FORSPA, is an outcome of the desire of the countries in the region and the donor community to develop a more self-reliant and sustainable mechanism to strengthen research networking. It was launched during the meeting of the Heads of Forestry Research Organizations in the Asia-Pacific held in Bogor, 20-23 February 1995.
The International Union of Forest Research Organizations (IUFRO) has recognised APAFRI as its Asia-Pacific chapter. APAFRI has been collaborating closely with the IUFRO Special Programme for Developing Countries (SPDC) in strengthening research in the Asia-Pacific region, and APAFRI’s Executive Director has been co-opted as regional coordinator of IUFRO-SPDC.
The Secretariat of the Association was initially based at the FAO Regional Office, Bangkok, Thailand. Following the decision of the First General Assembly of the Association held at Ho Chi Minh City in March 1997, the Secretariat has been shifted to the Faculty of Forestry, University Putra Malaysia(UPM), Selangor, Malaysia. In year 2001, Secretariat was relocated to Forest Research Institute Malaysia , Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.

We work globally, regionally and nationally to achieve the conservation and wise use of wetlands, in order to benefit biodiversity and human well-being. Wetlands International operates worldwide through 12 regional offices [link page main site offices] and seven project offices, all supported by our headquarters in the Netherlands.
We are supported by governmental and non-governmental members and by numerous sponsors, supporting the more than 100 projects that our worldwide organisation is currently conducting. Our projects [link to office project site] vary from field work, for example, aiding local communities in replanting degraded wetlands, to investigating the state of the world wetlands and advocating our views at governmental meetings.
In Malaysia, Wetlands International has been instrumental in the country’s accession to the Ramsar Convention in 1994, the designation of Tasek Bera as the first Ramsar Site for Malaysia and the implementation of the Ramsar Convention. The Government of Malaysia is a country member of Wetlands International since 2002.
Wetlands International Malaysia has developed several major regional programmes on waterbird and wetland monitoring and conservation action, including the Asian Waterbird Census (since 1991), the Asia-Pacific Migratory Waterbird Conservation Strategy (1996-2006) and the Asian Wetland Inventory (1999-2004).
Today, Wetlands International Malaysia focuses its activities in the following areas:
• Informing stakeholders and decision makers about the status and trends of wetlands in Malaysia
• Mainstreaming the role of wetlands in sustainable development
• Show the importance of the services and values of wetlands in Integrated Water Resource Management
• Conserving wetland species and habitats, in particular migratory waterbirds.
We provide technical, project and information services to a range of national and state government agencies and organizations to build capacity and to facilitate wetland conservation activities, and to ensure their wise use.
What our mission means for our daily work
This mission is the ‘umbrella’ for our activities. To give a brief example what this mission means for us:
We explore all kind activities to conserve wetland species with a focus on waterbirds and fish. Thousands of volunteers monitor millions of waterbirds annually. We collate and analyse this information to provide overviews of population trends and guidance for site designation to governments and wetland managers.
We work on the conservation of networks of sites that support migratory waterbirds (flyways), by checking their condition through regular moitoring programmes, raising awareness among the people living around these wetlands about their values and by enabling stakeholders and governments to conserve and manage them.
We also help people to conserve and restore wetlands for the services they provide – such as drinking water, fish, reeds for building material etc. We advise local organisations how to use their wetlands in a sustainable way and enable them to take action themselves. We inform their governments about the importance of wetlands for biodiversity and people and about ways to ensure their wise use.
We carry out research to elucidate and quantify the role of wetlands in water management. For example wetlands can play a role in water purification and in mitigating floods and droughts. We advise governments on how to integrate wetland management into water resource management programmes at the catchment or basin scale.
Guidelines for our work
In carrying out our work through all our offices and with partners, Wetlands International maintains the following core values.
1. Our work is globally relevant
2. Our work is based on sound science
3. We work through partnerships with a wide range of sectors
4. We respect traditional values and knowledge

The principal purpose of LWSMC was to oversee and coordinate development, planning and management of an area that was formerly known as Kota Kinabalu City Bird Sanctuary (KKCBS). This committee was made up of 16 component members including government agencies, private organisations, community groups and local NGOs, each separately constituted and registered. Together, they formed a unique collaborative partnership meant to benefit the larger urban and suburban community of Kota Kinabalu.
The formation of Sabah Wetlands Conservation Society was approved by the Registrar of Societies in August 22, 2005.

The declaration of Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZs) in the region necessitates SEAFDEC to play a more active role in assisting Member Countries to develop and manage the marine fisheries in the waters within the extended jurisdiction of their respective EEZs. This task needs to be tackled on a regional basis. With the establishment of MFRDMD, it is hoped that the regional needs and problems of coastal states, associated with the responsibility to conserve and manage the marine fisheries for sustained development, could be addressed more effectively.

WWF-Malaysia is a national conservation trust affiliated to the WWF global network. Working to promote harmony between human beings and nature for four decades, the organisation to date runs more than 90 projects covering a diverse range of environmental protection and nature conservation work in Malaysia.
WWF-Malaysia has come a long way since its coming into being on the 13th of January 1972. In the early days we had solely focused on wildlife conservation such as saving endangered species like the tigers and turtles, today our work has extended to encompass marine and forest conservation as well; from to protecting our highlands and forests, and also our rivers and seas.
Our work
We now also undertake scientific field research, public awareness campaigns, business and industry engagement, environmental education as well as policy advocacy. WWF-Malaysia works hand in hand with local communities to improve their livelihoods while enabling their participation in conservation as well as training and supporting other environmental protection organisations in Malaysia.
We are privileged to have more than 70,000 supporters who interact with us on Facebook; about 52,000 individual supporters who fund 34 critical projects; and even more financial backing from the corporations.
With your continued support, we stand the best chance of saving our biodiversity as well as achieving the sustainable management of our natural resources, to safeguard our good quality of life, and that of our children and future generations. WWF-Malaysia thanks you for your valuable support.
What does WWF stand for
WWF stands for World Wide Fund For Nature. It was formerly known as the World Wildlife Fund but adopted its current name to show that it also works on other environmental issues, and not just wildlife.
Who We Are
Established as a national conservation trust on 13 January 1972, WWF-Malaysia began as a humble two person-organisation. Today, we have close to 200 people working for us – from Kedah to Sabah. Also known as Tabung Alam Malaysia, we are governed by a Board of Trustees.
What We Do
WWF-Malaysia’s early work focused on scientific research of wildlife and important natural habitats. This later expanded to the management of protected areas. Today, our work covers the broader issues of the natural environment, incorporating such aspects as policy work, environmental education, public awareness and campaigns.
Where We Work
WWF-Malaysia is headquartered in Petaling Jaya, Selangor in Peninsular Malaysia, with programme offices in East Malaysia in Kota Kinabalu, Sabah and Kuching, Sarawak.
WWF-Malaysia also has a number of site offices in various parts of the country at locations where our conservation projects are carried out.

When Established: 01/1999
Description of Charity:
SABOT was started to help the local aboriginal (orang asli) community near Tasik Bera (Malaysia’s largest natural wetland) earn a living and be self-supportive. They provide services such as homestay and tour camps in the area.
The Semelai living around Tasek Bera have for centuries relied on the wetlands and forest for their livelihoods. In 1994, Tasek Bera was declared a Ramsar site – a wetland of international importance – and the government has since banned activities such as commercial hunting and fishing and forest clearing, which leaves the Semelai with fewer options for earning money.
Semelai Association for Boating and Tourism (SABOT) was set up with assistance from Wetlands International. It is fully owned and managed by the Semelai. This organisation is a community effort to ensure that tourism at Tasek Bera will generate a sustainable income for the local community, and consequently reduce the dependency on use of forest resources.
SABOT offers a variety of ecotourism activities and package tours including:
– homestay with local Semelai families
– several jungle camps where visitors can spend nights.
– Guided hikes through the rain forest that range from a two-hour medicinal plant trail to full-day treks.
– SABOT’s guides consequently complement their wetland tours with demonstrations of traditional farming and hunting techniques, folk music, and information about medicinal plants.
There has also been a resurgence in the production of Semelai handicrafts, which are sold out of SABOT’s headquarters.
NOTE: Tasek Bera is Malaysia’s largest natural wetland and first Ramsar site. Covering more than 3,000 hectares, the protected area comprises narrow rivers, open swamps, and dense tropical forests. The local flora includes rare orchids, and the aquatic purple water trumpet, a species found only in Tasek Bera. The area’s fauna is even more diverse, including endangered species such as the sun bear, Asian elephant and Malayan false gharial.

Selangor Family Aid Association is a non profit organisation with a primary aim of providing a home for the aged, handicapped, mentally retarded Down syndrome and the orphanage.
Our history
The Selangor Family Aid Association is a voluntary multi racial welfare organisation. It was established on the 8th of July 1988 by Mr Pusparajah Gunaratnam(G.P. Raj ), with the primary aim to help the needy such as the Old Folks, The Mentally Retarded , The Handicapped, The Down Syndrome and The Orphanage children etc. .In the past, the Association has also helped with provisions for the Poor and The Orang Asli (natives), and provided school meals for less privileged children. Due to the growing demands with the in house residents and lack of funding it has become necessary to just focus on the residents at hand.
Originally, the residents were accommodated in rented houses comprising a total of 12 residents. As the numbers grew, it was getting increasingly difficult to meet the needs of the residents. Hence, our founder member Mr G. P. Raj decided to build a better and a more permanent home for this unfortunate and under privileged society.
Currently, The Association has 87 residents and are able to accommodate up to 150. We also have about 15 members of staff, providing the necessary help and medical attention in the management of the home.
To maintain the home successfully, the Association is in constant need of funds, approximately Rm47,000 per month. At this level of funding, it is often a huge challenge. However, the management is always looking forward for ways in pushing the boundaries further in its struggle to have a smooth operation of the home.
Our objectives
Our activities
The residents are always encouraged to participate in recommended daily  activities in order to keep their minds and bodies in healthy condition. These are considered to be therapeutic and a good pastime.
Although most of the residents are not capable to carry out any responsible activities of their own, the staff do however conduct special occupational therapy programmes such as handy crafts and painting.
At times, the residents are given outing entertainments usually by voluntary groups. These may include dinners, social functions and other sight seeing activities.
Our needs

MHAS has taken on the task of organising the 1st World Congress on Healthy Ageing on 19 – 22 March, 2012 with the Theme: “Evolution: Holistic Ageing in an Age of Change”. The Congress is to be held at the Kuala Lumpur Convention Centre, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.
Healthy ageing is one of the major challenges for the world. The consequences of the demographic transition will have a tremendous impact on economy, health, social development and welfare of societies. Consequently, there is a need to enhance our knowledge about the promotion of good health among young and older people for a better quality of life in its later stages. Healthy ageing fostered by systematically planned health promotion efforts, was mentioned as early as 1998 as Target 5 in the WHO policy “Health for All in the 21st Century”. Active ageing (according to the European Commission) includes life-long learning, working longer, retiring later and more gradually, being active after retirement and engaging in capacity-enhancing and health-sustaining activities.
This first for Malaysia, if not the world, will encompass all aspects of health issues – prevention and management, the latest medical research and healthy ageing protocols – in both mainstream and complementary and alternative (CAM) medicines.
The Malaysian Healthy Ageing Society‘s primary objective is to create public awareness for enhancement of the quality of life. MHAS organises programmes to inform physicians, scientists and members of the public on advancement in medical sciences and biomedical technology to detect, prevent and treat age-related disease.",wcha@healthyageing.org / info@healthyageing.org,Malaysian Healthy Ageing Society – MHAS,http://ttp://healthyageing.org / http://www.healthyageingcongress.com/,,

Rita Home is a residential institution devoted to the care of orphans – children whose parents are deceased or otherwise unable to care for them. Parents, and sometimes grandparents, are legally responsible for supporting children, but in the absence of these or other relatives willing to care for the children, they become a ward of the state, and orphanages are a way of providing for their care and housing.  Children are educated within or outside of the orphanage. Rita Home provide an alternative to foster care or adoption by giving orphans a community-based setting in which they live and learn.
Our services
Generally we rescue children or un-attended old folks via public calls.  Upon bring them to our home we will seek all government related registration, police security reporting, preparing welcoming activity to make them stay.  In our effort if we not able to search their original parents or care taker then we will handle other process such if they are children register them in schools, if they are un-healthy then bring to hospital for health check up.
Within our care we will solve any birth certificate issue (BC), national resident identity card (NRIC) and obtaining those for them for better future as legal citizen of Malaysia.
Same of category for summary briefing we cover almost from born baby up to any age of gold age adults for both male and female.
Child disability care
Children are taken into care because they have a disability, normally a mental or learning disability. A team of carers would look after the children, who may or may not go home to their parents. Conditions and disabilities such as Autism, Down’s Syndrome, epilepsy and cerebral palsy (to name a few) may require that children receive professional as well personal care.
Adult disability care
Adults are taken into long-term care because of a disability, normally a mental disability such as Down’s Syndrome or Autism. This often has serious impacts on their life-opportunities – for example, working, having sexual relationships, or starting a family.
Foster Care
There are some children who, due to special needs or past abuse, are not best served in a group home setting.  This allows the child to bond with and be nurtured in a more intimate setting by a set of “parents.”.
Cradle Care
Offers a tender embrace as volunteers pray over each child by name, encouraging, training and standing beside nurses to help nurture little lives so that they experience loving human touch and are given a greater chance to develop normally.
Other Requirement
We will and have the basic facility from beds, food, multi-religious praying place to make them self a home.", persatuanritahome@gmail.com | rita@rita-home.com ,Persatuan Rumah Kebajikan Rita,http://www.rita-home.com/web/ ,,

A high number are left uncared by family members, staying alone, homeless and/or abandoned.
For us, this is a GOD-given opportunity to shower them with the LOVE of CHRIST and usher them into eternity. Some of these that are described are our residents. The majority of our residents are infirm. Amongst our major composition of residents are those that are wheel chair bound, stroke victims, those that are mentally unwell, semi paralysed and/or partially blind.
Caring for the elderly requires a lot of patience and love. Some have to be spoon fed, whilst others are to be carried for their baths. It is not so much the environment that matters to them but the LOVE of  GOD extended through human touch.
We praise and thank GOD for the dedicated staff who care for these precious ones.
We praise and thank GOD that these staff were our rehabilitated residents from our various Homes and Centres.
About Pusat Kebajikan Kalvari (PKK)
Pusat Kebajikan Kalvari Johor’s first home started in December 1989 at ‘Jalan Dapat’ in Johor Bahru. Today 23 Homes and Centres have been set up within the Johor Bahru area.
Our homes and rehabilitation centres are places of refuge for the sole purpose of touching our community with God’s love. By God’s grace, the needs of the helpless, abused, abandoned and the disadvantaged are looked after. Here, they can be rehabilitated and restored for a future with a hope.
On the other hand, our Special Education Centres provide the much needed intervention and learning support for the intellectually disabled.
We are also in the midst of developing Calvary Care Village (13.6 acre plot of land) – a centralised rehabilitation centre for those with substance abuse and the psychologically challenged (men) – at Pasir Gudang, Johor. Johor’s (PKK) Homes and Centres amount to RM2.53 million annually. The founding church (Calvary City Church) provides approximately 30% of the finances. The balance 70% come from general public- both individuals and corporations- who have been generous and faithful in their donations.
Our services
Presently we are sheltering, feeding, nurturing, educating or rehabilitating a total of over 580 people (residents, day special education centre children and care givers). The major expenses incurred are for food, utilities, rentals, vehicle maintenance, vehicle loan repayment and workers’ salaries.

When Established: 11/1996
NASAM (National Stroke Association of Malaysia or Persatuan Kebangsaan Angin Ahmar Malaysia) is a non-profit organisation founded six years ago in November 1996 by Janet Yeo to help Stroke survivors cope with the trauma of stroke and to provide rehabilitation facilities to help them return to a normal life as quickly as possible.

To educate the public on stroke prevention.
NASAM’s Activities
Group therapy sessions are conducted from 10.00am – 12.00 pm and from 2.00 – 4.00pm Monday to Friday at NASAM House, Petaling Jaya.
We provide physiotherapy, occupational therapy and speech therapy. These sessions are conducted by trained therapists assisted by volunteers.
Excursions and trips to various places of interest are also organised regularly for our stroke members. Please call the other centres for their opening hours.
Fees
Registration fees for stroke survivors are RM200 which includes a one-time membership fee of RM50, a thorough assessment by our therapist and the first month therapy fees. The fee forsubsequent months is only RM100 a month in NASAM, Petaling Jaya and Ampang and RM50 at the other centres.  If you wish to be a friend of NASAM, non-stroke members need only pay RM50 to join. There is no monthly fees.  As a member you will be sent a copy of our quarterly magazine Stroke News and will be invited to all our events.
NEEDS
NASAM volunteers help stroke survivors to regain their independence so that they can live life to the full once again. If you are lively, warm-hearted, friendly and have some time to spare, NASAM would welcome you to join us to help stroke survivors with their rehab. We provide volunteer training to give you an understanding of the requirements of the work involved. No qualifications are required – just your commitment and desire to help.

NEEDS
Volunteers are welcome! Disabled members can indeed be wonderful and sincere friends and vice versa for the volunteers. Through the direct interaction with them, we are always touched by their determination and courage in facing life albeit a tough one. This often leads and influences us to have a positive mindset as well. Being a volunteer, it is indeed our responsibility to inculcate and assist the disabled group to develop a higher level of self-reliance as well as achieving their financial and physical independence. It is also hoped that disabled group can find support and comfort in volunteers whenever they are needed spiritually, I believe through sheer sincere participation by volunteers, people with disability will be able to enjoy full participation and equality in society through active cooperation and encouragement by volunteers from various spectrum of the society.

Each event organised is based on at least one of the guiding principles below:
• To relieve hardship and poverty
• To bring a little joy to others
• To help the environment
We’re all concerned about disadvantage, deprivation and ignorance. Sewa Day provides an opportunity to do something positive that makes a meaningful difference to someone else’s quality of life.
We discourage all projects that involve fund-raising; as the purpose is to give your time. So, let’s focus on that.
It really doesn’t matter if you’re a pensioner or a young child, whether you’re physically able or not, or whether you black, brown or blue.
All that matters is that you commit to doing a good deed on Sewa Day, which takes place on Sunday, 7th October 2012.
Sewa Day is a secular, non-political, UK registered charity.",,Sewa Day – Malaysian Chapter,http://www.sewaday.org/,,

This project arises from the needs that have evolved from our traditional works of mercy with the poor in the outlying areas of PJ and KL and in particular the former squatter settlements.
Our services
Our works, observation and studies have clearly shown that in order to enable and empower the poor living in such areas, and more specifically the single mothers, obtaining full time employment has been hampered by the need for them to look after the younger children. This only allows them to seek part time housekeeping work where their monthly income often does not exceed 300 RM per month. This problem is further compounded if they do have to also support aged parents or if one of the spouses is disabled through accidents etc and bedridden.
A fundamental requirement in our efforts to raise their self esteem was the need to provide opportunities for them to seek gainful full time employment. At the same time, there is also a need to raise and enhance their skills to increase their earning potential.
The children on the other hand often require support (moral, financial and tutorial support) in education as well as the need for them acquire healthy habits of living, eat balanced diets regularly and obtain proper health care.
Providing opportunities to the Youth to help realise and develop their potential will be a very important aspect of the centre. Very often the youth and older children are neglected and tend to be dragged into the social vices that are linked with the general population in such areas. They lack avenues to develop their potential and this centre should help build their self-esteem and confidence so that the youths will be engaged in productive activities.

Who are we

This is a centre housing senior citizens who have been abandoned by their families.  Many of them were admitted to the hospitals for medical care by their own children and family members.  However, once they are ready to be discharged, their next of kin could not be contacted because the contact information provided to the hospitals were false.
These senior citizens were left behind at hospitals with nowhere to go.
Hospitals in the Klang Valley and other areas have been sending these senior citizens to Tong Sim centre for care and shelter.  The centre has been around for more than 10 years.
Some folks are immobile and in need of nursing care. Some volunteers come once or twice a week to help bathe the inmates, help with daily routines or simply keep them company.
Who is behind the centre
Mr Cheong Loy is a coffin-maker who runs the funeral parlour on the grounds of the Kwong Tong Cemetery in Sungei Besi, has opened the first floor of his shop to house these “guests”, he keeps accepting more people on the kindness and generosity of his heart. The centre has been around for more than 10 years. The hospitals provide them with free medical care but the expenses for the centre comes from Mr Cheong Loy and from the public.

When Established: 06/2002
By Whom: Mr Uthaya Perumal (Peru)
A home for the mentally ill who are homeless or from poor income group. It is one of the first to adopt an open concept method ie allowing most patients to lead a life as ordinary as possible, encouraging interaction with society. Activities include short trips out to the shops and having a drink at the local coffee-shop.
There are 107 patients at the home. The youngest patient is aged 17 years and the oldest is 87 years old. They live in three houses, all within the PJ area.

Counselling programmes are also organised with professional counsellors to help with the patients’ progress
Objective
Mr Peru gained vast experience from working in other mental institutions. His open concept method is based on the idea that mental illness is a sickness, not a disease, and therefore these patients should not be shunned or ridiculed by the public.

513,"Silver Jubilee Home For The Aged, Jalan Sungai Dua 11700 Pulau Pinang, Malaysia",Senior Citizens,+604 644 7942,,"Who are we

Silver Jubilee Home For The Aged stands proudly today as an impressive household name in Penang. It stretches over 22.5 acres of flat land with eight blocks of cluster units housing 124 rooms, 5 medical wards with over 80 beds, a rehabilitation centre, a physiotherapy section, a splendid dining hall and 2 kitchens to cater for the Muslim and non-Muslim Residents and a self contained laundry.
This HOME was established in the year 1935 to commemorate the Silver Anniversary of King George V. The land, situated in Sungai Dua, was donated by the late Mr.Cheah Leong Keah, J.P. for the aged destitute in Penang. ‘The Penang and Province Wellesley Silver Jubilee Fund’ was then launched to collect funds for the setting up of the HOME. Together the Straits Settlement Government, the Municipal Council of Georgetown and the general public managed to raise about $1,000,000.00 to set up the HOME. Thus in 1936, a Trust Fund was established under the name of ” The Penang and Province Wellesley Silver Jubilee Fund “
The Chief Minister, as Chairman and 3 other trustees are the administrators of the Fund, known as the Board of Trustees for the Fund. They are assisted by a 12-member General Management Committee headed by another Chairman whose function is to oversee the general administration of the HOME. They are all appointed into office by the State Executive Council. While the trustees are appointed for life, the members of the General Management Committee are appointed on a biennial basis and their services to be renewed for as long as they are needed by the HOME.
At the moment, there is the Manager, two assistant Managers, two Matrons, a Finance Officer and other section staff to provide the day-to-day running of the HOME.
Besides, the donation of the land by philanthropist, the late Mr.Cheah Leong Keah, J.P., other philanthropists like the late Honorable Khoo Sian Ewe, C.B.E.,O.B.E., J.P., donated 4 cottages in memory of his beloved wife, the late Mdm. Lee Sim Neoh and the Lim Kongsi ( Kew Leong Teong Lim Temple) donated another 4 more cottages. At that time, there was a visiting doctor, Y. B. Dato ‘ Seri Tan Ewe Aik, who started the clinic with the assistance of a few nurses from the Grey Sisters. He was then also a member of the General Management Committee. In the 1960 Dato’ Seri Dr.Tan advised, designed and set up a 25-bedded female medical ward for the sick. Referrals were made to the General Hospital for the resident who needed further treatment.
The HOME spends an average of RM 100,000.00 per month which totalled up to over RM 1 million each year. Through the kind generosity of the general public, the HOME is able to function smoothly even at difficult periods especially at times of recession.
The State Government of Penang and the Federal Government allocates annual grants to the HOME through the Ministry of Women, Family And Community Development. About 70% of the expenses came from the magnanimous hearts of the general public. The HOME always welcome donations, however small, in kind and especially in cash.

“They felt pained whenever coming across children who were abused or neglected, and so decided to do something to help. The home strives to give proper care and education to poor and abandoned children.” The home was started in 1990 by Mr Veerasingam A/L Ponnusamy with the support from his family members and under the sheltered of “Persatuan Hindu Sangam Malaysia” Mr Veerasingam is the founder of this Ashram whose family lived in the home for past 50 years.
From beginning the founder took care two teenagers and five old folks. He slowly expanded the ashram’s with orphans children. In 2002, he registered the ashram with name called “Sri Shenbagavalli Ashram Berhad” with the Register of Company.
The Ashram’s was a small house and wooden set -up and surrounded by the houses Mr Veerasingam and his family members fully taking care this Ashram.
Where are we
The Ashram currently located at 17th floor, E Block of Pangsapuri Kos Rendah, Bandar Tasik Selatan, 57000 Kuala Lumpur . Currently the Ashram has thirty three children, three old folks and two single mother (helpers – to help with the chores and cooking.). The Ashram is currently need to own the land to expand and rebuilt with complete facilities e.g., children playground, study room, prayers room, computer room, boys and girls separate living rooms and wide enough of kitchen and resting rooms. Current there is ongoing negotiation with government and developer for building the Ashram.
The principal activities of Ashram is acting as orphans home to those who are unlucky needs help for foods, clothes and shelter. The orphans also include the single mothers, needy women and old folks who being abandoned by the family members.
How you can help
The Ashram is functioning with the personal financial support from the founder and public donation and contribution in a way of cash and goods. Ashram is running many activities for the children and other orphans. The main functions are to school children eg:
Ø Education activities from Standard One to Form Five

Ø New Year Celebration and Children Performances
Ø Festival celebration – Deepavali, Ponggal and others

Ø Health and Cleaning Camping
In the near future, Sri Shenbagavalli Ashram is to continue playing an important role in bringing and upgrade the orphans. They realize that there is still a lot to be achieved since there are millions of children in the country who do not have proper caring and left as orphans outside.
Debates and discussions are constantly underway among the volunteers about how we can make a greater impact on the situation. As part of this learning process, the team and committee members are working closely with authority to acquire the land for developing their vision. The future holds even more significant challenges for all of the children at Ashram. It is more important than ever that every
concerned person pool in his efforts and start working towards addressing these challenges.
The Ashram is currently taking every single step to upgrade their services and contribution to their orphans.

Asia Community Service was established in October 1996, as a non-profit organisation with the vision of empowering people with special needs towards a more meaningful and fulfilling life. The focus however is targeted towards young children and adults with intellectual disabilities. The organisation is governed by a five member Board of Directors and has its base in Penang, a northern state in Peninsular Malaysia. ACS is a member of the Penang State Social Welfare Council.
The rationale of setting up the organisation derived from a four year joint research conducted by two of the founder members of the Board of Directors, Professor Ken Nakazawa of Japan College of Social Work and Associate Professor Dr Angeline Cheah of University Science of Malaysia.

Branch: 1 Lorong Sutera Prima 4, Seberang Jaya, 13700 Penang. Tel:+604-3984358
In April 1997, Asia Community Service started its first project, i.e. the First Step Centre, which provides early intervention programmes and services to babies, toddlers and preschool children with learning difficulties and developmental delays between the ages of 0 to 6 years.
The programme aims to stimulate all areas of a child’s development, such as gross and fine motor skills, cognitive, social and communication skills, conducted in individual one to one teaching sessions as well as small group activities. Activities carried out include infant massage, computer access, physical activities, art camp; craft, dough play, imaginative and pretend play, story-telling, drama, sand and water play, singing and music.
In May 2009, this early intervention service expanded onto the mainland in Seberang Jaya. This expansion is made possible in partnership with BOLD Association for Children with Special Needs Penang.
Jom! Mobile Toy Library (Mobile Phone : 016 – 4487006)
The main purpose of a toy library is to promote the development of children’s potential through play as well as to encourage leisure and recreational activities. A mobile toy library will be the vehicle to take up the challenge of making play and toys available to children who are not receiving any assistance, particularly those in the rural districts. This service started in April 2001 on a small scale by going out to 4 locations twice a month.
Stepping Stone Work Centre
53 Jalan Baru, MK I Pulau Betong, 11000 Balik Pulau, Penang. Tel: +604- 866 5349 Fax: +604-866 5887
In February 2000, Asia Community Service launched a small workplace called Stepping Stone Centre in Balik Pulau, a rural district of Penang for the adults with intellectual disabilities. The main thrust of the Stepping Stone Centre is to support people with intellectual disabilities to be more economically independent through job opportunities.
There are currently 24 members working in various work stations here at Stepping Stone, i.e. bakery, hand weaving, soap and paper making, batik painting and recycling. Members are exposed to the different work types for the initial 3 months, which is considered the training period. They will then be encouraged to make a choice depending on their interest and preference.
Pemancar House Respite Care Centre
227A Jalan Pemancar, Gelugor, 11700 Penang. Tel: +604-658 7857 Email: respitepg@gmail.com
This centre which started in 2010 is a place where families can leave their children with special needs when they need a temporary break. This service recognises the fact that caring for children with disabilities can be exhausting. A fresh environment or a short term relief is often times needed for both parties to renew their strength in order to continue and enjoy healthy living.

Set up Reverend Terence and Mrs.Kamala Sinnadurai  and registered with the Government Welfare Department and the Registrar of Societies with tax-exemption status, for underprivileged children and old folks. It does the work of Rumah Faith (established in 1985) for needy children and Faith Eagle’s Nest (established in 1992) for destitute senior citizens.
Nearly 500 (inclusive of the present) needy and poor children have been helped in their education and today many are doing well. They are working as a Civil Engineer, a Nurse, Computer Graduates, Salesmen, Businessmen, a Pet shop owner, etc. Twenty five years (25) of providing care and education  with the community’s help is not in vain. Educating the poor, the underprivileged, giving them hope and another opportunity to make it in life is Desa Amal Jireh’s mission and vision.
Desa Amal Jireh has also set up a Home School where about 30 children who do not fit into the Government schools are educated, giving them a second chance in education.
Our needs
The cost of running the Home is currently RM100,000 per month. Every year there are difficult financial months (Mar -Nov) where they find it hard to meet the Home’s needs. As such, your help and donation, big or small, will be much appreciated. The Government gives them an annual grant which takes care of only 14% of their needs. The rest (86%) comes from the caring public, individuals and corporations.
Renting 14 buildings all these years has challenged them to put up their own Building in a 4.2 acre piece of land in Semenyih, Selangor at a cost of RM7.5million. The village, Jireh Charity Village, is now complete. Currently there are 124 children and 14 senior citizens in their care there. Of the 124 children, 18 children are between the ages of 18 to 23 years. Some of these children are studying in colleges or universities or undergoing Industrial Training or taught special skills in a School for Special Children.
Desa Amal Jireh has a Management Committee made up of professional people who meet up monthly, who ensure that the Home is run with integrity and accountability. Their accounts are audited by Public Accountants annually.
Jireh Charity Village is able to accommodate  200 needy children and 50 destitute senior citizens.

When Established: 08/1991
Hospis Malaysia, the first hospice in Malaysia was formed in August 1991. It is born out of the awareness of the importance of introducing and developing professional palliative care for the public.  Hospis Malaysia is an independent charity, and is free from affiliation to other health institutions.
Palliative care is the active care for patients with fatal incurable diseases. Thus, Hospis Malaysia strives to provide the best service for patients and their families, where pain management and control of symptoms, as well as monitoring of psychological, emotional and social aspects are emphasised.
Hospis Malaysia provides palliative care both at home and at the day care centre. Palliative care at home is Hospis Malaysia’s main palliative care activity. They provide trained nurses to assist the patient’s family in taking care of the patient.
Hospis Malaysia is also involved in upgrading the education and skills of health workers in Malaysia on palliative care through various activities. These activities include training doctors and medical professionals on palliative care, networking with other local and overseas hospices, increasing public awareness on their services, and so on.
Hospis Malaysia extends their service to the homes of all Klang Valley residents. All services by Hospis Malaysia are free of charge.
Dependants
Hospis Malaysia caters to all patients with incurable disease. It is the only hospice in Malaysia to accept AIDS patients. Other than AIDS, most of the dependents suffer from these diseases:
*Cancer
*Nerve diseases (multiple sclerosis, motor neuron disease)
*Failure of one or more organs that effectively shortens life span
All patients must be referred to Hospis Malaysia by a specialist or family doctor to ensure the Palliative Care Team has the necessary medical records needed. Referral forms can be obtained at Hospis Malaysia office (see contacts).
Estimated Monthly Expenditure:     about RM1,000,000 a year, please see organisation’s website for latest information.
NEEDS
Hospis Malaysia is actively recruiting volunteers to help in a variety of ways. Our volunteers play an important part in our palliative care team and receive training and ongoing support from Hospis Malaysia.

We provide shelter for People Living With HIV and AIDS (PLWHA) who are rejected by family and society.  Homeless PLWHA who have been released from Hospitals but still need to continue medicine intake, dressing of wounds or are at the terminal stage of AIDS will find a safe shelter.
The Foundation ensures that necessary treatment is administered and also ensures follow-up treatment with doctors and hospitals. PLWHA are given a clean and hygienic place to stay and nutritional food to assist in the recovery process.
The shelter is provided for a period, depending on clients; needs, their progression in health status and the social reintegration process. PLWHA at the facility also act as caregivers to other PLWHA who are in terminal stages and in need of care.
The Pelangi Community Foundation began in September 1998 with no funding support and has largely depended on the goodwill of individuals, like the French Community in Kuala Lumpur, the Netherlands Embassy and Stiftung Umverteilen in Germany.
The Foundation has since grown, a reflection of its need and importance, to serve more homeless persons living with HIV/AIDS. Today, we totally rely now on our self. Overseas funding is no more coming to us as Malaysia is considered by funding agencies as a developed country.
To start small income generated projects, we received funding from the European Union through DOH International. We have started a small scale printing business. Please contact us for all your printing needs. We print from business cards to booklets and even books.
Our mission
– Ensure that all homeless Persons living with HIV and AIDS (PLWHA) have access to basic medical care and treatment for opportunistic infections
– Ensure that all homeless PLWHA will be able to live and die with pride and dignity.
Our services
– Provide a place to stay, recuperate and rebuild their mental and physical strength
– Provide counselling and a friendly, non-judgemental home
– Provide a space to die with dignity
– We conduct outreach to homeless PLWHA at hospitals and to street-based Drug users
– Pelangi provides support to homes, poor families and children, infected/affected by HIV
– We arrange detoxification for HIV positive heroin users at hospitals and follow-up care with psychiatrists. We also provide medical treatments for Heroin Dependent HIV positive Drug User

NEEDS
Volunteers are welcome! Disabled members can indeed be wonderful and sincere friends and vice versa for the volunteers. Through the direct interaction with them, we are always touched by their determination and courage in facing life albeit a tough one. This often leads and influences us to have a positive mindset as well. Being a volunteer, it is indeed our responsibility to inculcate and assist the disabled group to develop a higher level of self-reliance as well as achieving their financial and physical independence. It is also hoped that disabled group can find support and comfort in volunteers whenever they are needed spiritually, I believe through sheer sincere participation by volunteers, people with disability will be able to enjoy full participation and equality in society through active cooperation and encouragement by volunteers from various spectrum of the society.

It aids single parents who are struggling to keep their balance at home and work place; advises teenagers caught in gang violence, sex and drugs; looks after the elderly struggling to keep pace with progress. Such is the reality in our society and these do worry politicians and families alike. These changes threaten to rend the very social fabric of society.
Against such a scenario, Association of Services and Community Development of Gombak District, Selangor (PSPK) is set up to provide assistance, education, training, therapy and basic counseling to the needy and challenged. It aims to strengthen the family unit – the foundation to any society. PSPK, a non-profit voluntary welfare and charitable organization, is affiliated to the Selangor Council of Welfare & Social Development.
PSPK empowers women to be effective decision makers in order to achieve economic, social and gender justice through the concept of equality through human rights for all. Through various programs on Economic and Social Justice, Gender and Governance and Sustainable Development, PSPK emphasizes women’s critical role in social, economic and political spheres.
PSPK embraces a four-fold Aim:-
– Walking along side the target group member to lead to growth and a brighter future.
– Uplifting the community to realise their worth and dignity.
– Educate both young and old to build and establish a better environment.
– Bringing hope to those who are alienated from their own community.
With our above aims, we have managed to restore part of our community of individuals and families, transformed and empowered with a renewed sense of purpose, living in wholeness to reach their fullest potential and to become channels of service and support for the other needy in the larger community.

The impact of AIDS on children and adults are both complex and multifaceted. Many suffer intense psychosocial and economic distress. If the children have lost their parents to AIDS, most must live with the stigma and discrimination attached to the disease. WAKE uses a holistic approach to the management of the children’s health and for the other residents of the Homes.

SWWS is a non- governmental, non- profit organisation dedicated to the promotion of women’s equality and elimination of violence against women and children. The beginnings of the Society go back to 1984 when a group of concerned women got together. SWWS was officially registered in July 1985.
Among the pioneers were Hew Cheng Sim, Ling How Kee, Beverley Cox, Valerie Mashman, Margaret Bedus and Fiona Masing. The then State Minister for Welfare, Datuk Hafsah Harun, helped the group in its registration as she shared the view that there was an urgent need for a women’s NGO to be formed to specifically look at and address women’s issues.
History
The group decided to open a crisis phone line and prepare for this by organising training but to do this we needed some cash, trainers and a place to hold a course. The headmistress of St. Teresa’s, Molly Chong, came to our rescue by offering us the use of a classroom in the evenings so we could hold our first training sessions.
Once again Datuk Hafsah Harun helped us by offering us the free, temporary use of an old school building built by her family at the back of their house near Satok Bridge. It became our first base for several years. It was here we congregated, had our meetings, planned SWWS programmes, developed our resource centre and organised our famous ‘pot lucks’ and it was here 1988, that the Women Crisis Phoneline (CPL) was launched. It became the first phone line service run solely by volunteers to act as a listening ear for women in distress.
As the programmes and visions expanded, the group felt that we needed to move to a more central place. Therefore, in 1993, SWWS shifted to the 1st Floor of the Sarawak Teachers’ Union (STU) building in Rock Road. Later in the same year SWWS opened our Drop- in Centre who was launched by our guest of honour, Yang Berhormat Puan Rohani Bt Karim.
Our new premises however proved to be a bit cramped, and also needed by STU, so in 1994 SWWS shifted a few blocks away to the present Centre at Lot 1610, 2nd Floor, Rock Road, Kuching.
Today we have gained the confidence of the State Government and receive funding from them to carry out most of our programmes which we greatly appreciated. We are extremely proud of our achievements yet we know we have much more work to do to be able to offer a consistent, active and effective service to women in need of our help.

About Pusat Kebajikan Kalvari (PKK)
Pusat Kebajikan Kalvari Johor’s first home started in December 1989 at ‘Jalan Dapat’ in Johor Bahru. Today 23 Homes and Centres have been set up within the Johor Bahru area.
Our homes and rehabilitation centres are places of refuge for the sole purpose of touching our community with God’s love. By God’s grace, the needs of the helpless, abused, abandoned and the disadvantaged are looked after. Here, they can be rehabilitated and restored for a future with a hope.
On the other hand, our Special Education Centres provide the much needed intervention and learning support for the intellectually disabled.
We are also in the midst of developing Calvary Care Village (13.6 acre plot of land) – a centralised rehabilitation centre for those with substance abuse and the psychologically challenged (men) – at Pasir Gudang, Johor. Johor’s (PKK) Homes and Centres amount to RM2.53 million annually. The founding church (Calvary City Church) provides approximately 30% of the finances. The balance 70% come from general public- both individuals and corporations- who have been generous and faithful in their donations.
Our needs
Presently we are sheltering, feeding, nurturing, educating or rehabilitating a total of over 580 people (residents, day special education centre children and care givers). The major expenses incurred are for food, utilities, rentals, vehicle maintenance, vehicle loan repayment and workers’ salaries.

We see a critical role for ourselves in filling the gap between the promise of women’s rights and their actual realisation.
We contribute to the progressive interpretation, universalisation, implementation and realisation of women’s human rights through the lens of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women and other international human rights treaties. We facilitate a process through which the CEDAW Convention is used as a tool for applying international human rights standards at the national level and in a wide range of contexts (e.g. political participation, armed conflict, rights in marriage, violence against women, trafficking reproductive rights, employment, etc).
The experiences gained have contributed to the development of knowledge and skills, and created a better understanding of the various dimensions of equality, non-discrimination, State obligation, human rights principles (e.g. universality and indivisibility), and a rights-based approach to development.
As women become more motivated and capable in linking domestic activism with international advocacy, it is also necessary that IWRAW Asia Pacific take on new roles to maximise our potential to trigger changes in law and policy. As such, the next phase of our work will build on the existing knowledge base to develop a new set of tools that further strengthens women’s rights activism.
IWRAW Asia Pacific regularly works in 12 countries in South and South-east Asia and is expanding such work to other areas of the Asia and Pacific region (e.g. Central Asia , the Pacific). At the same time our presence and expertise expands beyond Asia Pacific, especially through our work at the regional and international arenas.
We focus on women and women’s NGOs, as well as work with human rights.
Philosophy
As a human rights organisation, IWRAW Asia Pacific places women at the centre of our work. We are committed to generating conditions and spaces which nurture opportunities for sharing, creating awareness of and realising human rights for all women. We seek to accomplish this through a spirit of respect for and mutual cooperation with those we work with.
Vision
IWRAW Asia Pacific envisions a world where there is full realisation and enjoyment of human rights by all. Women’s equality is integral to this achievement. We believe that through this societies can be transformed so as to achieve a balance of power, and sustainable and equitable development conducive to realising human rights.
Our Mission
To achieve our vision, we adopt a human rights approach and focus on the experiences of women from the South.

Mission
“To provide the leadership and inspiration to act as a conduit to the transformation of the role of women in business into a dynamic force”
NAWEM was founded on the firm belief that the full realisation of the human potential is limited only by the acquisition of skill and knowledge and the availability of information and opportunities.
NAWEM is mindful of the importance of human resource development. It will therefore be in the forefront of initiatives to harness and develop under-utilised human resources, particularly women, by enhancing their skills and knowledge, and through the dissemination of information. In the widening of business opportunities, NAWEM members will ensure a consistent focus on quality, productivity and performance.
As the platform for women entrepreneurs, NAWEM is also the leadership that will influence and shape policies which will benefit women in business in particular and the nation in general.
Conscious of our ever changing and demanding environment, NAWEM is the inspiration to stimulate innovation and creativity in the development of business strategies that will be sensitive to local values and customer needs.
NAWEM also recognises the need for cohesiveness in forging business relationships. To this end NAWEM will be the bridge to transcend differences and to the nurturing of co-operation and mutually satisfying business environment within and outside our national boundaries.
By the year 2020, NAWEM members will be acknowledged not only as catalysts to the growth, development and enhancement of women in business but also as a motivating force, providing leadership and support to all Malaysians in the realisation of their full potential whilst upholding the values of mutual respect and caring.

If God is just as Islam is just “ why do laws and policies made in the name of Islam create injustice? This was the burning question faced by the founding members of Sisters in Islam (SIS) when they began their search for solutions to the problem of discrimination against Muslim women in the name of Islam.
The group first assembled in 1987 within the Association of the Women Lawyers (AWL) when several women lawyers and their friends came together under the Association’s Shariah subcommittee to study problems associated with the implementation of new Islamic Family Laws that had been legislated in 1984, and enforced in 1987. The group was composed of lawyers, academics, journalists, analysts, and activists, and many women confided in them their marital problems and the difficulties they faced when seeking legal redress from religious authorities. These early meetings focused on problems with the law and its implementation, and the solutions needed to remedy shortcomings within the system.
The group held its first meetings in the living room of a house shared by Zainah Anwar, a former journalist and senior analyst and Noor Farida Ariffin, then President of AWL and Legal Advisor to the Economic Planning Unit in the Prime Minister’s Department.
The group’s first initiative was to organise a workshop in 1988 involving the National Council of Women’s Organisations, the Federal Government’s Women’s Affairs Division, and the Islamic Centre (Pusat Islam) of the Prime Minister’s Department. The workshop sought to alert the authorities to the problems women faced with the implementation of the new Family Laws, and to recommend substantive legal and procedural reform to ensure that Muslim women’s rights were upheld under the law.

As one of a mere handful of southern-based international organisations, our roots are humble. It all began in 1999, amidst a raging war in Kosovo where thousands of lives were lost and suffering was widespread. Moved by the plight of countless innocent civilians, especially women and children, Dr. Jemilah Mahmood, a Malaysian obstetrician-gynaecologist, sought to offer her services voluntarily.
Finding no national organisation ready to support such international crises, together with a handful of like-minded friends, the Malaysian Medical Relief Society – better known today as MERCY Malaysia – was established. MERCY Malaysia aimed to provide a platform for Malaysians to unite and take their role in the international humanitarian arena.
Dr. Jemilah Mahmood led the first mission to Kosovo in June of 1999. Several missions followed and teams were made up of Malaysians from all walks of life with the single goal of helping others, regardless of race, religion, culture or boundary.
Over the last decade, the organisation has blossomed with teams sent to disaster-stricken zones and programmes rolled out in various countries and in different disasters. As a registered society under the Societies Act, MERCY Malaysia has over 500 members and is supported by approximately 5,000 registered volunteers to date.
Our mission and core values
All staff and volunteers are to uphold the MERCY Malaysia Mission and Core Values in performing their duties at the Headquarters, Country Field Operations and any locations where staff and volunteers are required to represent the organisation.

The year was 1985. Malaysia had neither a law against domestic violence abuse nor adequate protections for survivors of such abuse. Our laws against rape were archaic and discouraged survivors from filing reports. Our federal constitution did not prohibit discrimination on the basis of gender, and our labour laws did not protect employees from sexual harassment at the workplace. “Women’s issues” were seen as private affairs and not as matters of public policy.
It was in this context that a coalition of women’s rights groups called the Joint Action Group against Violence Against Women (JAG-VAW) (today known simply as the Joint Action Group) organised a workshop and exhibition to highlight the phenomenon of “violence against women” in Malaysia. For the first time, rape, domestic violence, sexual harassment, prostitution, and the negative portrayal of women in the media were highlighted as matters of public concern.
The success of this historic two-day event inspired the formation of several women’s rights organisations, including AWAM. These organisations have maintained close ties ever since, coming together through JAG to lobby collectively for a more equal and non-violent community and nation.
Since then, AWAM has worked tirelessly to advocate for, serve, and empower survivors of violence and the wider public. Through our advocacy, AWAM has taken “women’s issues” from the personal and situated them squarely in the public, political sphere. In so doing, we have helped break the silence on gender-based violence.
Who we are today
A quarter of a century on, AWAM can proudly claim a role in bringing about a change in public discourse and opinion around women’s rights and seeing through some significant law reforms, namely the Domestic Violence Act, enacted in 1994, and, in 2001, the inclusion of “gender” in Article 8 of the Federal Constitution.
But AWAM’s work has not been in the area of advocacy and law reform alone. From the very start, our focus has been on public education and outreach. Over the years, we have developed and run trainings on rape awareness, anti-sexual harassment policy, gender sensitisation, women’s leadership and political participation, and others. These trainings variously target healthcare providers, police officers, school-going children and teenagers, survivors, indigenous communities, the corporate sector, and government officials. Through the MAN.V and Pulau Carey outreach programmes, AWAM has also worked to build alliances with men who share our values and with marginalised communities. And through its Women Writers for Rights and Alliance Building programmes and its involvement with Fiesta Feminista, AWAM continues to work on establishing a nationwide feminist movement in Malaysia.
Our services
As well, we provide counselling and legal aid services to survivors of gender-based violence. AWAM launched the Telenita helpline in 1997 and has since been serving the public with the help of dedicated volunteer para-counsellors and chambering students from the Legal Aid Centre.
Not satisfied with fighting for the codification of our rights to be free from gender-based violence and discrimination, AWAM actively seeks to inform all women of our rights and to help us claim them in our various roles as workers, students, mothers, lovers, survivors, and so on. Along the years, AWAM has found it necessary to move beyond a focus on gender-based violence to take a more holistic view of the concerns and challenges that face women in Malaysia today. For the past several years, AWAM members have held internal and public discussions on how to best serve as a feminist organisation in our contemporary context, given the challenges of limited resources and a heavily circumscribed space for public action. These have culminated in a review of AWAM’s vision and values as well as a restructuring of the organisation.
At a retreat in 2009, AWAM members decided to articulate the core values of the organisation, those that all members agree to uphold in their daily lives and work and that would be realised in AWAM’s daily operations and organisational mission, and in the interpersonal relationships between its members and staff. These values were integrity, compassion and respect, collectivism, courage, and justice and equality. The core values, and the process of determining them, reflect AWAM’s desire to operate as a space that nourishes its members, volunteers, and the larger community which it serves.
At the same time, we have restructured the organisation to focus on key areas of research and advocacy and streamline our operations so that we are more sustainable and better adept at responding to and building alliances around emerging issues and events of relevance to our work, values, and vision. As we look at what AWAM has achieved, we are reminded of how much remains to be done.

Yayasan Sejahtera is dedicated to addressing extreme poverty in line with two National Key Result Areas: raising living standards of low-income households, and improving basic rural infrastructure.
Our work with the hardcore poor invests in both short term needs and long term outcomes. While Malaysia is a success story in the area of poverty reduction, the poor still rely on handouts which do not contribute towards long term impact or independent existence. Yayasan Sejahtera was created to demonstrate that there is a more sustainable approach to providing social welfare to communities.
We believe in collaboration and the goodwill of caring individuals and organisations. This includes Government-Linked Companies (GLCs), Government-Linked Investment Companies (GLICs), the private sector, government agencies, academic institutions, non-governmental organisations and other players. Working together is essential to achieve success in poverty alleviation.
Our Objectives
•To ensure that Sejahtera communities have access to a basic standard of living and enjoy at least a minimum quality of life.
•To support the creation of sustainable living environments for vulnerable communities in Malaysia.
•To deliver this mandate through the efforts of Government-Linked Companies, Government-Linked Investment Companies, and corporate Malaysia.
•To work in partnership with beneficiaries and civil society to leverage and maximise programme benefits.",info@sejahtera.my,Yayasan Sejahtera,http://www.sejahtera.my,,

ARROW is a regional non-profit women’s NGO based in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, and has consultative status with the Economic and Social Council of the United Nations. Since it was established in 1993, it has been working to advance women’s health, affirmative sexuality and rights, and empower women through information and knowledge, engagement, advocacy and mobilisation.
ARROW was built upon a needs assessment arising out of a regional women’s health project1 that involved the compilation of information materials on women’s health and rights. The assessment of women NGO’s and health activists and advocates showed that there was a great demand for practical information from other countries to assist women’s groups in planning and implementing their activities, especially in relation to gender sensitisation, reproductive health and rights and violence against women. Realising the wealth of information that was in existence but not easily available to women’s and health rights advocates in the region, ARROW’s founders established the organisation with the vision to create a resource centre that would “enable women to better define and control their lives.”2
ARROW’s original objectives as envisioned in 1993 were to provide information and materials to strengthen initiatives to reorient health policies and programmes so that they are more sensitive and responsive to women’s needs and perspectives; to strengthen the capacity of women’s NGO’s in the region towards influencing population and family planning programmes; and to generate new information and analysis of women’s health through collaborative research.3
These objectives have evolved over the years, while our activities have expanded in breadth and increased in their depth of complexity. Our current work spans information and communications, knowledge exchange and transfer, evidence generation for advocacy, consistent monitoring of progress towards relevant international commitments made vis-a-vis women’s health, capacity building, partnership building for advocacy, engagement at international and regional fora, and enhancing the organisational strength of both ARROW and partners.",arrow@arrow.org.my,Asian-Pacific Resource & Research Centre for Women (ARROW),http://www.arrow.org.my,,

Our needs
As a non profit charity organisation, Kasih Foundation depends on public support. However, public fund-raising is labour intensive and taxing on the public who are already facing financial challenges.

In this way, the Foundation aims to enable KHC and its public-serving activities to enjoy a higher degree of self-funding and self-sustenance

An independent, non-religious, non-governmental organisation based in Malaysia, committed to confronting violence against women. WAO opened Malaysia’s first Women’s Refuge, providing shelter, counselling and child support to battered women.
In 1979, the late Tun Tan Siew Sin was awarded the Tun Razak Award for his invaluable contribution to the country. He generously donated his cash award of RM 30,000 to establish a shelter for battered women and their children.
A pro tem committee, headed by Puan Sri E.N. Chong, had its first meeting in November 1981. It took 9 months to lay the groundwork and to form a core group of volunteers. These pioneer volunteers worked as a collective to formulate the operating principles of self help and self empowerment for battered women who turned to WAO for help.
In June 1982, WAO received temporary registration as a society and a single storey house was rented as WAO’s refuge and office premises.
The Malay Mail published the first article about the planned Refuge. On a Saturday morning in September 1982, a call came in: “She has left her husband with her two children, could she stay for a while?” This woman and her two children were WAO’s first residents.
Our vision, mission and philosophy

To create a society that is free of violence against women
The fundamental belief of Women’s Aid Organisation (WAO) is that no one deserves to be battered. We believe that all human beings have the right to self determination and should have control over the conditions that shape their lives.
Our objectives
Our services
The services provided by WAO includes:
*Refuge – WAO provides a home to battered women and their children. The refuge is also a centre for WAO’s activities relating to family, women and domestic violence issues.
*Telephone Counselling – Telephone counselling is available to deal with women’s problems, crisis situations and to provide basic legal information. You can call the following number: +603-79563488
*SMS Helpline to help victim survivors of domestic abuse.  SMS Tina if you need a friend to talk to: 018 988 8058
Mon – Sat: 9:00 am – 5:00 pm
*Face-To-Face Counselling
Qualified social workers offer counselling sessions to women who may not necessarily seek shelter but want counselling. Appointments with social workers required.
*Anak Angkat Programme
The Child Sponsorship Programme for the children of WAO’s ex-residents. Monthly donations are made to meet the school expenses of a needy child.
*Child Care Centre
A Centre for the children of WAO’s ex-residents who have decided to live independently. The children are given a home, education at local schools and a support system to meet their physical, mental and emotional needs.
Our needs

Every year WAO is helped by many volunteers. Your help is invaluable. They are always looking for volunteers, but they do need people who are able to make a regular commitment. Please contact them if you are able to help in any of the following areas:
You can help by:
– Making a donation
– Making a grant
– Sponsoring a child through the Anak Angkat Programme

We are not an organization. We are just a group of individuals who want to provide our love and care to the less fortunate.

In August 2015, our mobile clinic was formed. The vision of our group was to start a free mobile clinic to provide free medical care for the homeless, urban poor and everyone else who cannot afford it.
What do we do?
Most of the homeless and urban poor are ashamed to be seen in public as some of them feel they are not socially accepted by the community. Our intentions are not to change the current healthcare system, but to be the first contact to them, providing at least the basic medical care they need and at the same time providing them the necessary information and knowledge about other resources provided by the community. We also provide full assistance as necessary to obtain those services.
Every single one of them deserve our love and care without discrimination based on race, religion, gender, sexual orientation or residency.
When and where?
Day : Every Wednesday
Time: 9.30pm onwards till the last patient seen.
Location: Jalan Hang Lekiu (right in front of Segi College)

ANGSANAcare’s mission is to provide counselling, creative arts and holistic therapies to hospitalised children and families requiring palliative care. We aim to reduce their stress and suffering whilst creating a positive and stimulating environment during their last days together. Our vision is that we become the leading non-governmental organisation providing complementary palliative care services to underprivileged children and their families in Malaysia.
ANGSANAcare is a fully registered not-for-profit Malaysian Society created as a support service to palliative care for underprivileged paediatric patients and their families in Government hospitals in Malaysia. Our services are free of charge. We depend completely on public and corporate funding and are not affiliated to any political or religious groups.
In 2011, Dr Loh Ee Chin of UMMC identified a need for a type of special care for her palliative care patients who were suffering enormous pain and extreme stress. In Singapore and in most Western countries, doctors were tapping into the expertise of art, play and music therapies that were not often used in Malaysia. Dr. Loh was determined to introduce such complementary support for the children in her care. She approached a music therapist in Kuala Lumpur who was eager to volunteer her services. The benefits of this type of therapy were immediately evident. She discovered that the children were becoming less fearful and, in turn, experiencing less pain. A sense of calm and internal well-being was restored to them. Singing or playing with musical instruments with the therapist allowed children to experience joy; songs and poetry helped them to express their innermost fears for the future.
The next step was to secure funding for this pilot programme. Ms. Chung, herself a cancer survivor, generously offered her financial support; for three years she paid for a music therapist at University Malaya medical Centre.
In 2014, Dr. Loh trained a younger paediatrician, Dr. Lee Chee Chan, in Palliative Care. He too was drawn to music therapy, recognising its benefits as a complementary component to his medical care. The doctors together decided to expand these services to more families. This would now be beyond the capacity of a few individuals so Ms Chung approached Datin Catherine Lai who already ran another charity and had her hands full.  Catherine, having mulled over the idea for a couple of months, invited her friend, Ria Thomas; someone she knew would make a serious commitment to the initiative, to the next meeting with the doctors. To her complete surprise, Ria, who thought she was just attending a meeting, was asked to become the Chairperson of this new and yet unnamed entity.
Ria Thomas founded the new Society, ANGSANAcare.  She picked a committee of dedicated members whose comprehensive vision was to offer much more than expressive arts therapy alone. The ‘A Little Wish’ programme was introduced and the support network was expanded to include group sessions for children in art and music. The enthusiasm and hard work of this team, led to the inauguration and registration of ANGSANAcare, a new Malaysian Society, on the 3rd March 2015.",info@angsanacare.org,ANGSANAcare,http://www.angsanacare.org/,,

The Persatuan Psoriasis Malaysia (Psoriasis Association Of Malaysia) is a registered, non-profit, self-help, lay organisation of psoriasis sufferers started in 1987 to help improve the life of people with psoriasis and their families. It is funded by public donations, membership dues and grants from friends in the pharmaceutical industry and is served by a few Medical Advisors who are practising dermatologists from the Dermatological Society of Malaysia.
What is Psoriasis
Psoriasis is a chronic, autoimmune mediated disease which symptoms are seen visibly on the skin. It occurs when the immune system sends out faulty signals that speed up the growth cycle of skin cells. Psoriasis is not contagious.
Individuals with psoriasis are at an elevated risk to develop other chronic and serious health conditions also known as “comorbidities.” It is estimated that up to 30 percent of people with psoriasis develop psoriatic arthritis. People with psoriatic diseases also are at greater risk of developing cardiovascular disease and depression.
125 million people worldwide—2 to 3 percent of the total population—have psoriasis, according to the World Psoriasis Day consortium. Studies show that between 10 and 30 percent of people with psoriasis also develop psoriatic arthritis. (Source: http://www.psoriasis.org/learn_statistics)
Given that the population of Malaysia is 28,250,400 (Source: Population, Household and Living Quarters (2010), Department of Statistics, Malaysia.) – it is estimated that 500,000 to 800,000 Malaysians are afflicted with Psoriasis.

The history of the society and the Rehabilitation Home is long and eventful . The pioneer of this society was Dato’ Seri M Mahadevan. He , a consultant psychiatrist of Hospital Bahagia, in October 1969 suggested a pilot project of a rehabilitation programme for the emotionally disturbed persons and medically cured mental patients. Thus the society began functioning humbly at 28 Clarke Street , Ipoh. In the first 10 months of operation , the Centre provided 20 mental patients with supervised occupational therapy sessions daily.
From various findings made through discussions and the Pilot Project, it was then decided that a voluntary body be formed with the aim of securing the cooperation and interest of the public on mental health. The main objectives of the body was to devise programmes to break down the public prejudice that is being held against mentally cured patients. It was also to establish ways by which aftercare and rehabilitation could be made available to the discharged persons in cooperation with the Government Psychiatric Service. The Perak Society for the Promotion of Mental Health was thus formed on 9 September 1970 under the distinguished patronage of HRH the Sultan of Perak with a total membership of 80 persons. Mr. FL Cowie was elected the first President of the Society and held this office until 1976.

Cleft Lip and Palate Association of Malaysia (CLAPAM) is a non-profit, non-government organisation and a support group consisting of volunteers from parents with children born with cleft lip and/or palate, adults with cleft lip and/or palate and healthcare professionals who manage such individuals. First established in 1992 and officially registered with the Registrar of Societies (R.O.S) in 1993, CLAPAM provides various support services including counselling, information on feeding and care of cleft babies, and hospital/house visits. CLAPAM also functions as a link between members and medical professionals.
Our objective
CLAPAM’s mission is to educate and increase the awareness level of the public regarding the management of cleft individuals and cleft issues through our various activities whilst striving to be a one stop centre for cleft issues nationwide. CLAPAM also aims to be the link between parents who wish to seek medical assistance and the medical professionals.
Our services
Our activities include hospitals, clinics, and home visits to provide counselling and guidance on the correct feeding techniques for a cleft baby as proper feeding is essential to a baby’s growth and development. CLAPAM is a member of the Combined Cleft Clinic at University Malaya Medical Centre (UMMC) and Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia Medical Centre (UKMMC). We meet parents with cleft children and adults with cleft condition on the first Friday morning at UMMC and second Monday afternoon every month at UKMCC to further provide counselling and guidance sessions along with providing a link between parents and medical professionals.
We also conduct information sessions for members and health professionals through our Annual General Meetings and public forum/member get-together where medical professionals are invited to present special topics. Furthermore, CLAPAM attends medical conferences and participate in seminars and lectures to increase the awareness on cleft. We also publish and distribute leaflets on cleft for parents and medical professionals for the convenience of all parties and further increase the awareness and education level of cleft.
CLAPAM is a self-supporting body, relying on donations mainly from CLAPAM members, private corporations and members of the public. The funds received are channelled into the running of our office and helping less fortunate families with cleft children. CLAPAM strives to encourage more local support groups nationwide.
Volunteers offer moral support and feeding advice to parents of newborns with clefts. We supply special feeding bottles and teats. Our volunteers (usually parents of a child with a cleft themselves) aim to encourage new parents in the early days, extending hope to parents who may be in the state of depression and shock.
The combined knowledge and experience of our parent members in tackling cleft-related problems with their own children, together with the input from our professional members means that CLAPAM has access to reliable information on a wide variety of cleft related issues in addition to acting as a one stop centre for cleft issues in Malaysia. We stock a number of information booklets and leaflets on cleft. We also keep a list of healthcare professionals such as orthodontist, plastic surgeons and speech therapists nationwide to guide parents to the services available.

More on Yayasan Kebajikan SSL Haemodialysis

Every year, about 2,500 people in our nation have been discovered to suffer from kidney failure. Throughout Malaysia, only 10% of them get preferential dialysis care provided by government hospitals. A dialysis session at a private hospital cost at least RM150 to RM250, and generally, each patient requires 3 dialysis a week. This costs anything from RM1,950 to over RM3,250 each month, expenses that many cannot afford, equivalent to their average income for few months. Yayasan Kebajikan SSL Haemodialysis was set up in May 1994 by Rev. Sze Chang Heng when she realised during her visits to rural areas that there were many kidney patients who urgently needed help for haemodialysis due to insufficient facilities in our country. The centre started off with only six machines in 1994. This foundation was then awarded by the Prime Minister’s Department in July 1999 with the objective to provide subsidised dialysis to needy patients, regardless of race, creed or religion.
Our aim
*To encourage patients to rebuild their confidence
*To help patients continue their role playing for family and society
*To sponsor kidney Transplant Fund at local Government Hospital
*To call for organ donors for kidney patients
*Preventive medical check up facility for preliminary diagnosis heart and kidney illness detection.
*All accepted poor patients pay only RM50.00 per haemodialysis treatment
*FOC treatment for patients who cannot even afford of RM50.00 per treatment
*To provide medical allowance for each patient
*To provide educational funds for the patients children
*To provide medical rehabilitation service for patient

Medical treatment for patients cost an average of RM27,000.00 to RM30,000 and it is almost impossible to send every patient in the waiting list.
Whilst the list of patients seeking treatment keeps growing, the S.O.S Heart Fund can only hope for more donations to pour in, thus ensuring a second chance of life to the less fortunate. The society depends on the public and government support to carry out its aims and objectives. To-date the S.O.S Heart Fund has sponsored over 500 patients. Most of the patients sponsored to the Institut Jantung Negara and Gleneagles Medical Centre, Kuala Lumpur. The S.O.S Heart Fund since it existent for 30 years to-date, is one of the new charitable/voluntary organization which doesn’t have any full time paid staff.
Hence, the administrative costs are kept very low. The S.O.S Heart Fund will continue to raise funds so that more people who cannot afford to go for further treatment and surgeries could be helped and have their second chance at living a better life.",info@sabahheartfund.com,Society for the Sabah Heart Fund (SOSHF),http://sabahheartfund.org,,

To date, we have been treating cancer patients with three Linear Accelerators, PET-CT Scanner, and other diagnostic tools. Our medical team consists of highly qualified Clinical Oncologists and Radiotherapists, Medical Physicists, Therapy and Diagnostic Radiographers and Oncology Nurses.
As a not-for profit organisation, our mission is to offer respectful, compassionate and integrated healthcare which will include the use of modern technology, in such a way that all who come to us will experience themselves as being infinitely valued by a compassionate God.
Who are we

Mount Miriam Cancer Hospital was founded 38 years ago as a not-for-profit hospital by the Sisters of The Franciscan Missionaries of the Divine Motherhood to provide compassionate nursing care to those in the late stages of cancer. Recognising the intensive need for active cancer treatment, Mount Miriam expanded into a cancer treatment centre while continuing with palliative care.
Today we are one of the leading cancer hospitals in Malaysia offering a wide range of cancer services. The commitment to high quality, compassionate and holistic care at the most affordable cost has always been our mission since our inception. To date we have treated and cared for more than 30,000 cancer patients. The public is now able to relate to us as a mission hospital offering one of the best cancer treatments in the region.
Mount Miriam is a not-for-profit hospital, we do not compromise on the quality of our services. On the contrary, we always strive to give the best standard in cancer care and treatment to all our patients regardless of age, race or religion. Mount Miriam Cancer Hospital has since the early 80’s provide radiotherapy treatment services to the Ministry of Health for patients referred by the General Hospital in the Northern Region.
Why supporting Mount Miriam is such a worthy cause?
More importantly we have a policy in place of not turning away patients just because they do not have the means to pay deposits for treatment or admission. 
Our appeal 
As a not-for-profit cancer hospital, we do not receive grand or funding from the government. We rely heavily on the support of the community.
We are appealing for financial support for a 12 seater Toyota passenger van at an estimate cost of RM120,000.00 where we can provide free transport services for patients from the general hospital referred to Mount Miriam Cancer Hospital for treatment. We are also looking at offering transport services for outstation patients who may require medical procedure at other hospitals where Mount Miriam is not equipped with.
Mount Miriam Cancer Hospital do not own a ambulance nor a passenger van to support such services for the community at this point of time. Moving forward we hope to be able to offer free transport services for the benefit of cancer patients.

MPDA is the first non-governmental and patient-based organisation set up on 12th September 1994 as support group for people with Parkinson and their caregivers in the country. It is also the third of its kind in Asia after Japan and Hong Kong at the time of its incorporation.
The Association was initially registered as the Parkinson’s Disease of Selangor and Federal Territory (PERSATUAN PARKINSON SELANGOR DAN WILAYAH PERSEKUTUAN) with the Registrar of Societies of Malaysia bearing the Registration No: 5642/94 Selangor. In 1996, the name of the association was changed to Malaysian Parkinson’s Disease Association (PERSATUAN PARKINSON MALAYSIA) to be more representative of the Parkinson community in the country. It was officially launched on 6th April 1996 by the then Minister of Health of Malaysia, YB Dato’ Chua Jui Meng. In October 2005, it received its tax-exempt status from the Inland Revenue Department of Malaysia.
In the early years of the association, the Secretariat was located at the homes of members due to its limited financial resources. Today, it is located at its rented premises, a single-storey corner lot terrace house located in Happy Gardens, Old Klang Road, Kuala Lumpur since October 2005. It is a place which we called our “Parkinson Centre”.
As at 31st October 2008, MPDA has a total registration of 637 members comprising 376 people with Parkinson, 134 caregivers and 127 supporters. In terms of gender, there are 293 males and 344 females.

The idea of setting up an Alzheimer’s Disease Foundation of Malaysia was first mooted in 1996 by a member of the Rotary Club of Shah Alam (RCSA), Selangor, whose mother is an Alzheimer’s patient.
The Alzheimer’s Disease Foundation was registered in August 1997 and obtained tax-exemption status in September, 1999.
As founder of the Foundation, RCSA has pledged to raise RM500,000 for Alzheimer’s Disease Foundation Malaysia (ADFM). The various fund raising projects organised for this purpose included an Operafest Charity Performance (“Flower Drum Song”) in 1998, as well as two Treasure Hunts in 1998 and 1999. The Lee Foundation has also donated RM200,000 to ADFM, much of this amount being specified for the setting up of the country’s first Alzheimer’s Daycare Centre.
The continued commitment towards ADFM by a small club with less than 40 members has been highly commended by Rotary International. In recognition of RCSA’s singular effort in this endeavour, RCSA was awarded Rotary International’s Significant Achievement Award in 1998.
Also in 1998, ADFM became a provisional member of Alzheimer’s Disease International (ADI), the umbrella organisation of national Alzheimer’s associations around the world. ADFM’s new logo reflects this relationship.
The Foundation’s Secretariat was set up in February 2000, with one full-time paid staff (Administrator Ms. Karen Yong) and the newly created position of Executive Secretary of the ADFM Executive Committee held by volunteer Ms. Chew Kheng Leng.
With this, ADFM launched the new millennium with new resolve and an ambitious agenda to further the Alzheimer’s cause in Malaysia.
Our mission
Alzheimer’s Disease Foundation Malaysia is a non-profit organisation set up to promote awareness of Alzheimer’s Disease in Malaysia, and to help dementia patients and their families living in Malaysia.
This mission will be implemented through:

Sister Lai Yi Feng then arranged for Brother David Liu, CEO of Melaka Branch, to visit Miri.

On 26 March 2000, volunteers from Kota Kinabalu went to Tawau again to investigate a case involving the brother and sister of a Malay student in Sabah University who needed financial assistance. In October 2000, Liang Li Qing, a Tzu Chi Kota Kinabalu Office staff, decided to return to her hometown in Tawau. Liang, with the help of two local Buddhist friends, took on responsibility for this case, thus sowing Tzu Chi’s seeds of love and kindness in Tawau.
In July 2001, Tzu Chi Kota Kinabalu Office organised a volunteer training program for the second time that year. Brother Pang Zhi Qing from Tawau attended this course. After he returned to Tawau, he started Tawau contact point to encourage more volunteers to participate in Tzu Chi’s missions. He also accepted some of the cases referred to him by the local Buddhist Association. On 5 September 2001, Tzu Chi Melaka CEO, Brother David Liu, accompanied by Brother Ji Long, visited the Tawau contact point. After a better understanding of the locality of Tawau, Kota Kinabalu and Sandakan, he decided to let Tzu Chi Sandakan Liaison Office assist and support volunteers in Tawau. Sister Xia Ci Hui, who is the liaison person from Sandakan, started to visit Tawau once a month with help from Brother Pang De Yi. She helped volunteers in Tawau to set up administrative procedures, organise fellowship, home visit, relief distribution, recycling and other charity work.
On 6 February 2003, David Liu brought a group of volunteers to visit Tawau contact point. There he noticed that the volunteers and Tzu Chi’s activities have grown tremendously. With such an encouragement, he suggested that Melaka Office apply for Tawau to be set up as an official contact point.

On one of her visits to the old folks’ home in 1996, Sister Lai met Brother Huang Wen De, Sister Shen Xi Chan, Brother Huang Mao Sheng and Brother Yu. Since that meeting, Sister Lai had been receiving the Tzu Chi monthly magazine and Still Thoughts Aphorisms booklet from these Tzu Chi volunteers. Sister Lai, however, did not really pay much attention to these printed materials. But on 7 October 1996, when she visited the Melaka Branch and met up with Brother David Liu, she came to fully understand the beauty and philosophy behind Tzu Chi’s missions. Sister Lai was then appointed as the person-in-charge of Kuching Contact Point.
Realizing the distance between East and West Malaysia, Brother David Liu set up a Contact Point in Kuching with Sister Lai unanimously appointed as the person-in-charge. Upon her return to Kuching, Sister Lai converted the back portion of her company for use as Tzu Chi Contact Point.
The Kuching Contact Point has since embarked on the journey of continuing the missions of Tzu Chi in Kuching. Helping the poor has become the foundation of Tzu Chi’s missions. After obtaining information on two poor families, the Contact Point immediately started their home visits. The membership in Kuching increased tremendously within a year, coupled with increased activities. As such, it was soon realized that the existing Contact Point needed a bigger space.

Volunteers from Kota Kinabalu Liaison Office also drove three hours to Tenom, a small town in Sabah to raise fund for this purpose. This was how Tzu Chi sowed seeds of love and kindness in the town of Tenom.
After the fundraising event, some Tzu Chi volunteers who travelled frequently for business between Tenom and Kota Kinabalu, brought some Tzu Chi Magazines and books to Tenom. In early 2000, and on the invitation of the Tenom Buddhist Society, brothers and sisters of Kota Kinabalu Liaison Office organised a small tea reception to introduce Tzu Chi to Tenom.
At that time, the living standard and education of many residents of Tenom was quite poor. As such, many were living in poverty and required care and assistance from society. After acquiring this information, Tzu Chi volunteers from Kota Kinbalu decided to pay regular home visits to Tenom. These activities attracted some residents in Tenom to become Tzu Chi volunteers.
In September 2000, and with the help of Tenom residents, Sister Li Li Hua, Brother Huang Jing Yuan and some others attended the volunteer training organised by Kota Kinabalu because they were very touched by Tzu Chi’s spirit of Great Love. After the training, these volunteers decided to form a Tzu Chi contact point in Tenom so that they can start to help others.
After returning to Tenom, the brothers and sisters immediately dedicated their time in carrying out Tzu Chi’s missions and at the same time, organised training and fellowship for volunteers. They hope to nurture a group of Bodhisattva in Tenom.
Brother Aw Yong Kee Kong, Brother Li Ji Zhuan and others from Kota Kinabalu, always travelled from Kota Kinabalu to help and assist volunteers in Tenom.

After a few exchanges of views, they finally seized upon the opportunity to set up a contact point at this remote township in East Malaysia.
In July 2000, a team of sixteen members from the Taiwan Teachers’ Association went to Sandakan to promote the teaching of Jing Si Aphorisms. The Sandakan people were very impressed and touched by the lively teaching method demonstrated by these Tzu Chi teachers, their sense of commitment and their warmth and courage. In August 2000, the teachers from Sandakan formed a Teachers’ Association, and in November of that year, they joined the West Malaysian Teachers’ Association on a visit to Tzu Chi Taiwan. From this visit, they brought back with them many excellent teaching resources and also helped to promote further the teaching of Jing Si Aphorisms. The group of teachers also played a key role in promoting the “Happy Children Achievement Classes” and recycling missions to schools.

As such, a Tzu Chi tea talk was then organized. Brother David Liu briefed the attendees on Tzu Chi’s missions and this home visit case in East Malaysia. Most of the Buddhist attendees were touched and impressed with Brother David Liu’s sharing. They also admired the contributions and sacrifices made by Tzu Chi brothers and sisters. As a result, and prior to the team of six leaving Kota Kinabalu, this group of Buddhist friends decided to join Tzu Chi in promoting the spirit of great love.
In November 1996, Brother David Liu visited Sabah again to present a talk on “Well Blessed Life” and introduced missions of Tzu Chi to the people of Kota Kinabalu. With this talk, and with the call for more people to join Tzu Chi, the Sabah team of volunteers has been growing steadily ever since. As a result, the charity efforts of Tzu Chi in helping the poor and needy have successfully reached out to many parts of Sabah.

However, as there was no Tzu Chi Office in Kuantan, her burning desire to do charity could not be realized.
In November 2001, when she learnt that Tzu Chi Melaka people were coming to Kuantan to give a talk on “Well Blessed Life” the following month, she was very excited. She immediately contacted Sister Echo Chien and offered to help in the promotion of Tzu Chi’s missions in Kuantan. Then in December 2001, many parts of Pahang experienced severe flooding. Tzu Chi people from Melaka and Kuala Lumpur went to Kuantan for the scheduled talk and, at the same time, took the opportunity to assess the flood situation, together with the local brothers and sisters. They then distributed emergency relief to the flood victims. That was how the Tzu Chi volunteers brought the spirit of great love to Kuantan; and later with the kindness and efforts of the locals, the foundation of a pure stream in Kuantan was laid.
Through the encouragement of Sister Gong Xiu Juan, Tzu Chi volunteers from Melaka and Kuala Lumpur went frequently to Kuantan to support the promotion of Tzu Chi’s missions there. As such, and within a period of just a few months, fifty-two volunteers and more than 300 donating members were recruited. In February 2002, the contact point in Kuantan was officially set up to promote the missions of “Helping the poor and educating the rich”.
In order to have a bigger base and to grow further, Sister Gong Xiu Juan successfully convinced her family members to let out a double-storey bungalow in town to be used as the office for the new contact point.
Then, with the support of some active members, she planned and organized more activities which have successfully brought in more members. That was how they started the missions in helping the poor in the streets as well as supporting other charitable organizations. Sister Gong’s commitment and dedication in the promotion of Tzu Chi’s missions made the culture of great love a reality.
With the rapid expansion of Tzu Chi activities, the existing space was found to be inadequate. As a result, at the end of 2002, Kuantan Tzu Chi people rented a three-storey shoplot from the Kuantan Town Council, This 3,200 square metre shoplot became the office for the contact point; which was officially open on 17 November. Though the space is limited, the office managed to house the Buddha Hall, AV room, Meeting Room, Pantry and a corner to display Jing Si books.
With a place to call their own, Kuantan Tzu Chi people began to organise more activities in the hope of recruiting more members to join Tzu Chi’s great love missions.

In December 2002, the daughter of Mr Lin Zi Liang, a donating member of Kluang, died in a road accident in Melbourne, Australia. With no relatives in Australia, Mr Lin contacted the Johore Bharu Liaison Office to seek help from Tzu Chi Melbourne. Tzu Chi volunteers from Melbourne rendered their full assistance to the family, as well as, attended to all the necessary final rites. Upon their return to Malaysia in March 2003, the Lin family offered for free a double-storey shop to be used as Tzu Chi Kota Tinggi Office.

Within the next two years there was an increase in the number of cases in Muar and the volunteers from Melaka had to make more frequent trips.
In 1994, Brother David Liu of Melaka Branch was actively looking for someone from Muar to join Tzu Chi and cultivate this field of blessings. The volunteers from Melaka have made frequent trips to Muar to carry out home visits, organize tea receptions and talks, as well as visiting schools to spread the spirit of Tzu Chi to the locals. As a result, a few brothers and sisters who have worked with Melaka volunteers decided to form the Muar Chapter.
In 1998, Sister Huang Yue E from Muar offered her double-storey bungalow to be used as Tzu Chi Muar Office.

On 2 September 1995 when Melaka Liaison Office officially formed the Tzu Chi Teachers’ Association, Sister Yao was one of the participants. She turned out to be the only outstanding officer from the Teachers’ Association who participated in the teacher root-seeking trip for five consecutive years.
In November 1995, Sister Yao participated in the root-seeking trip to Hualien, Taiwan, for Malaysian teachers for the first time. She was so touched during the trip that she proactively advocated Still Thought education upon her return to Malaysia. In addition to that, she encouraged teachers in her hometown to take on the task of aiding the poor and educating the rich, which is Tzu Chi’s main mission.
However, Tzu Chi in Tampin did not have an office. Tzu Chi brothers and sisters held their meetings in gazebos in the park, shades under the trees or in coffee shops. Tzu Chi’s nearest Liaison Office is in Melaka, which is about 40 km away. Travelling to and fro especially at night was dangerous, therefore the idea of looking for a branch office in Tampin surfaced.
In order to create a place where Tzu Chi brothers and sisters could meet, learn and mingle with each other, Sister Ci Ting suggested renting a lot for this purpose. Coincidentally, one of the sisters had two shoplots to be rented out, and with the consent of her husband, the lots were offered to Tzu Chi to use as Liaison Office.
In order to inform Buddhist friends and philanthropists in Tampin about Tzu Chi’s permanent local Liaison Office, an opening ceremony was held on May 25, 1999. Dozens of brothers and sisters from Melaka Branch, led by Brother David Liu and Sister Echo Chien, came to extend their best wishes. Ever since then, philanthropists in the area have participated in various Tzu Chi activities including house visits, recycling activities and hospital volunteer services, among others.
The number of Tzu Chi brothers and sisters in Tampin grew daily, and people from all walks of life have since joined Tzu Chi’s Great Love fraternity, which included teachers, laundry workers, sewing ladies, coffee shop operators, hairdressers and others. Interestingly, most of the Tzu Chi volunteers here are teachers.

Almost immediately, and at Sister Echo Chien’s encouragement, she returned to Taiwan to seek her roots. Upon learning more about the work of Tzu Chi, Sister Huang set out to promote Tzu Chi in Seremban. At the same time, the parents of Brother Hu Zhen Jun were kind enough to provide the first floor of their shophouse to be used as the centre. This started the mission of aiding the poor and educating the rich.
Seremban is about 70 km from Melaka, and it was covered initially by the ten odd Tzu Chi staff from Melaka who used to travel north to guide and monitor the work of helping the needy.
In September 1995, Tzu Chi Teachers’ Association was officially formed in Melaka and that prompted teachers in Seremban to participate. In 1996, about thirty teachers who were teaching Still Thought programme gathered once a month, thus bringing about the formation of Seremban Teachers’ Association. The monthly gathering also brought in many teachers who later became Tzu Chi volunteers.
In April 1999, upon recognising Tzu Chi, Sister Nie Mei Yan and Sister Zhou Sai Hua pledged and bought a strategically located double-storey shophouse (with an area measuring 3,000 sq ft each floor, 6,000 sq ft both floors) for Tzu Chi to set up a Liaison Office. Renovation work for the Liaison Office started in October.
At the end of March 2000, following the completion of software and hardware facilities, the Seremban Branch was officially open on April 16. The training course for Tzu Chi trainee commissioners from Central and Southern Malaysia was also held on the same day, bringing together Tzu Chi volunteers and officers to share their thoughts and good wishes.
The set-up of Tzu Chi Seremban has significantly brought together kindminded people to aid the poor and educate the rich. Its increased activities and the need for further development saw to the upgrade of the contact point to that of a Liaison Office. This was realized in December 2002, marking a new milestone for the propagation of Tzu Chi work in Seremban.
Sister Nie Mei Yan, the person-in-charge of Seremban Liaison Office, lives in Kuala Lumpur, but she has no complaints about travelling frequently between Kuala Lumpur and Seremban for meetings and activities.

Tzu Chi Klang started its operation through an elderly couple, Lim Kok Hua and Tan Ngin Nea, who are both in their seventies. On a trip to Hualien, they witnessed the kindness demonstrated by Master Cheng Yen, and were touched by the spirit of Tzu Chi members in giving without hesitation and never expecting any reward in return. There and then, they decided to participate more actively in Tzu Chi work and donated four units of shoplots in Klang, turning them into the Klang Centre. On 31 August 2002, and with blessings from Master Cheng Yen, Tzu Chi Klang was officially opened by Tzu Chi’s Overseas Chief Executive Officer, Huang Si Xian.

Then on 29 November 1996, Brother David Liu and Brother Liao Shu Ding from Johore Bharu held a talk at Chung Hua Old Boys’ Association in Kluang. That evening, Brother David Liu spoke to more than fifty attendees about Tzu Chi’s missions. It was at this meeting that Brother Ong Seng Yeow and a few Buddhist friends came to understand the virtues of Tzu Chi. They then affirmed their support and acceptance of Tzu Chi’s missions.

In January 1997, about ten brothers and sisters decided to shoulder the responsibility of promoting Tzu Chi’s missions in Kluang.
Due to the 80 km distance from Kluang to Johore Bharu, and for the convenience and ease of promoting Tzu Chi activities, Brother Ong Seng Yeow and Brother Han De Hua consulted with Brother David Liu and Sister Echo Chien about the possibility of setting up a local office.

She vividly recalled that while waiting for her turn in a beauty salon, she browsed through some magazines and came across Tzu Chi’s monthly publications. She was deeply moved by the good deeds carried out by Tzu Chi and it was then that she realized her personal aspiration of helping the poor. She promptly donated two hospital beds to Tzu Chi (Taipei Branch) and subsequently signed up as a Tzu Chi member.
Leading the Factory Workers to Carry Out the Missions
In August 1992, Brother David Liu and Sister Echo Chien visited Venerable Master Bo-Yuan in Kuala Lumpur. The Master praised the humanitarian work of Master Cheng Yen. He encouraged them to take on this noble work and extend these deeds to Malaysia. A contact number of one of Tzu Chi’s members in Malaysia was obtained from the Master. Thus the door of Tzu Chi was opened for them to propagate the ideals and values of humanitarian work. For a start, Sister Echo Chien introduced Tzu Chi to her factory workers and encouraged them to join the organization. They enthusiastically signed up as members. At the initial stage, they raised funds by sacrificing their lunch breaks to make handicrafts for sale at charity fairs.
Vital Decision Made After Visit to the Birthplace of Tzu Chi
In November 1992, with the encouragement of Sister Ye Ci Jing, Sister Echo Chien visited Tzu Chi Headquarters in Hualien. There she had the opportunity to understand the true teachings of Master Cheng Yen and her close associates, all of whom adhered strictly to the principle of ‘no work, no meals’. Encouraged by Sister Echo Chien, Brother David Liu led a 22-member team to Hualien on 7 November 1993. Their arrival and presence were well received by Master Cheng Yen personally. Brother David Liu was deeply moved by Tzu Chi’s serenity; and inspired by Master Cheng Yen’s gestures of utmost sincerity, he became a staunch Tzu Chi follower. He vowed to take on the challenges of spreading the principles and good teachings of Master Cheng Yen. Upon his return to Melaka, Brother Liu immediately set about organizing and promoting Tzu Chi’s activities by utilizing the conference room and samples display room in his factory.
From Scratch to Today’s Achievements, Weaving the Tzu Chi Bodhisattva Net
Having been conferred as Tzu Chi Commissioners by Master Cheng Yen in early 1994, Brother David Liu and Sister Echo Chien started their untiring efforts of setting up more Liaison Centers across Malaysia. From Melaka, the seeds of love spread to Kuala Lumpur, Seremban, Muar, Kota Tinggi, Kluang, Tampin, Batu Pahat, Klang, and Kuantan. This then led to the progressive establishment of more Liaison Centres in East Malaysia, namely, Kota Kinabalu, Tenom, Sandakan, Tawau, Kuching and Miri. Thus the Malaysian network of bodhisattvas had grown into a sizeable and recognizable organization. The network is still growing today.

In March 1995, Melaka officially became a Contact Office. Brother David Liu and Sister Echo Chien were subsequently appointed to take charge of Tzu Chi’s affairs in Melaka and Kuala Lumpur. With utmost confidence, enthusiasm and dedication, coupled with blessings from Master Cheng Yen, Brother David Liu later decided to donate a piece of land adjacent to his factory to Tzu Chi for the purpose of building the Hall of Still Thoughts. On 21 May 1997, the Melaka Tzu Chi Still Thoughts Hall, the first of its kind in Malaysia, was completed. Master De Xuan from Hualien was invited to visit Melaka and officiate at the Opening Ceremony, and at the same time, upgrade Melaka’s Contact Office to a Liaison Office. In June 1998, Melaka Liaison Office was further upgraded to a Tzu Chi Branch Office.

This was followed by the monthly visit to Sg Buluh home for the lepers. The said activities have continued till this day, and the ever increasing number of long term poor family cases has become KL Tzu Chi’s foundation.

In response to the urgent and pressing global call for sustainably produced palm oil, the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) was formed in 2004 with the objective promoting the growth and use of sustainable oil palm products through credible global standards and engagement of stakeholders.
The seat of the association is in Zurich, Switzerland, while the secretariat is currently based in Kuala Lumpur with a satellite office in Jakarta.
RSPO is a not-for-profit association that unites stakeholders from seven sectors of the palm oil industry – oil palm producers, palm oil processors or traders, consumer goods manufacturers, retailers, banks and investors, environmental or nature conservation NGOs and social or developmental NGOs – to develop and implement global standards for sustainable palm oil.
Such multi-stakeholder representation is mirrored in the governance structure of RSPO such that seats in the Executive Board and project level Working Groups are fairly allocated to each sector. In this way, RSPO lives out the philosophy of the “round-table” by giving equal rights to each stakeholder group to bring group-specific agendas to the round-table, facilitating traditionally adversarial stakeholders and business competitors to work together towards a common objective and making decisions by consensus.
Volunteer Information
Agriculture has changed the relationship between man and nature more than anything else and forever. As the world population continues to rise agriculture will continue to expand to feed, cloth and protect mankind. The largest expansions will be in the tropics where favourable climatic conditions can give high agricultural productivity. The tropics have now emerged as the world’s foremost supplier of edible oils, made possible by modern cultivation of the earth’s most precocious edible oil bearing plant – the oil palm or Elaeis guineensis Jacq. The oils it produces, palm oil and palm kernel oil, are versatile food products with a wide range of uses. They are also a greener substitute for petrochemicals in some applications.
The rise in demand for food, including edible oils, with increasing population and higher standards of living, as pushed to demand for palm oil. The result has been very rapid expansion of this crop in the tropics particular in Malaysia in the second half of the last century and in Indonesia at the turn of this century. Rapid expansion naturally rapidly exerts pressure, in this case on the environment – including biodiversity rich lands – and on the social fabric. Issues of deforestation and biodiversity loss, trampling of land rights, etc. are bound to rise. The RSPO is a unique multi-stakeholder platform to address the expansion of palm oil without undue pressure on the environment and society.
More on RSPO

RSPO is a non-for profit organisation aimed “at promoting the production and use of sustainable palm oil through co-operation within the supply chain open dialogue between its stakeholders”. On 8 April 2004, the “Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO),” was formally established under the Swiss Civil Code with a governance structure that ensures fair representation of all stakeholders throughout the entire supply chain. The seat of the association is in Zurich, Switzerland, while the secretariat is in Kuala Lumpur. The RSPO Indonesia Liaison Office was established in December 2006 to promote the overall objectives of the RSPO in Indonesia. The office, among others, assists in the implementation and monitoring progress of the RSPO projects in Indonesia, facilitate for the inclusion of smallholders in RSPO processes in Indonesia and provide guidance to Indonesian companies seeking for RSPO certification.
Our activities

The not-for-profit association has members representing major players along the palm oil supply chain, namely the oil palm growers, palm oil processors and traders, consumer goods manufacturers, retailers, banks and investors, environmental/nature conservation NGOs and social/development NGOs. The RSPO recognises that palm oil is an important and versatile raw material for both food and non-food industries, which contributes to the economic development of the producing countries and to the diets of millions of people around the world. However, it believes that production and use of palm oil must be done in a sustainable manner based on economic, social and environmental viability. Towards this end, the RSPO is promoting the production and use of sustainable palm oil through the following activities:
National Interpretation of RSPO P&C in Colombia, Thailand, Ghana & Solomon Isles
Continuing approval of Independent Certification Bodies for RSPO P&C and SC certification.
Accreditation of Independent Certification Bodies for RSPO certification
Accreditation of HCV assessors
Development of Biodiversity compensation mechanisms.
Sustainability criteria for Smallholders (scheme and independent)
Group Certification Scheme for smallholders
Trial Audits of scheme smallholders

We believe that we will reverse the grip of cancer in our lives. We want researchers to win the war against cancer by turning it around with new ways of prevention and cure. We want to empower the public through impactful outreach programmes, with the hopes that Malaysians will respond differently to cancer by coming forward for screenings and going through with treatments.

It currently has over one thousand members across the country. The management of POCAM is under the control of elected members and they are assisted by voluntary helpers and four full-time employees. POCAM complies strictly with the requirements of the Registrar of Societies, and its accounts are audited regularly by a public accounting firm. On this website, which we aim to make accessible and effective, we present our Society, as well as some reference information, for our members and anyone concerned with disabled people in Malaysia or anywhere. Thank you for your visit, we hope to hear from you! ..
History of POCAM
During the seventies, though several groups of disabled such as the blind of deaf had voluntary societies working to help them, there was no such society looking after the interests of the orthopaedically disabled who are the most numerous of all. So Mr. Appu Raman, the first Principal of Pusat Pemulihan Cheras who had just retired from a senior post in the Social Welfare Department, together with Mr. Hugh Storey, another retired civil servant disabled by polio in middle life, invited a group of like-minded people to a meeting in the latter’s house on the 23rd of August 1974. They formed a pro tem committee, and made a number of basic decisions. It was agreed to form a national body at once, rather than go through intermediate stages; to be a society “of” rather than “for”; and to adopt more user-friendly policies and practices than those provided by the Social Welfare Department, who were pressed on one side by the numbers of people wishing to register, and on the other by the limited finance, manpower, and other resources which Parliament was willing to give them.
Our inaugural meeting was held a year later at Pusat Sukan Kampong Pandan on the 10th of August 1975, which we take as our birth date. We had at that time about three hundred prospective members, eighty of whom were present; and Mr. E.G. Ross, who was Director of Rehabilitation in the Department, kindly came as Guest of Honour and gave us their encouragement. However we had to wait another year until our registration was approved in September 1976, which allowed us to recruit new members and expand our activities. So in POCAM the ordinary members are disabled people, and only they can vote at general meetings; however other people are welcome as associate members, and can be elected to office or appointed to committees.",mypocam@tm.net.my,"Society of the Orthopaedically Handicapped, Malaysia (POCAM)",http://pocam.org,,

Malaysian Dietitians’ Association (MDA) was established in 1994 with Professor Dr Fatimah Arshad as the first president.
Back in the early 1970s and 1980s, there were less than 10 dietitians in Ministry of Health and only 2 to 3 dietitians in private medical centres. The only institution of higher learning that produced dietitians for the country then was Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia (UKM). The first batch of dietitians graduated from UKM in 1989.
As years went by, the number of dietitians in Malaysia increased. The early dietitians saw the need to form an association to drive and guide the growth of the profession. In 1994, the Malaysian Dietitians’ Association’ (Persatuan Dietitian Malaysia) was born. The establishment of the Code of Ethics is the first step by the association to increase the professional integrity of all dietitians in Malaysia. This code of ethics remains an integral part of MDA today.

The history of leprosy in Malaysia goes back to over 300 years, and was probably brought in by the early immigrants.
Some of these early immigrants, terribly deformed by the diseases of leprosy, lived in the same villages and towns as the other inhabitants. The disease of leprosy was, in those early years considered as dangerous and contagious and could easily spread from one person to another.
FORCIBLE ISOLATION OF LEPERS
The Government therefore, at that early period, in order to protect the inhabitants from being infected by leprosy, enacted draconian laws to forcibly isolate those suffering from the disease of leprosy from the other inhabitants.
These unfortunate human beings treated more as sub-humans were forcibly isolated into very remote camps in the deep jungle in places such as Pulau Jerjajak (1871) Pulau Pangkor (1903), Tampoi , Pulau Seribun (1850) Setapak, Kota Baru, and the leper asylum in Circular Road, Kuala Lumpur (now Jalan Tun Abdul Razak).
SUNGEI BULOH LEPROSARIUM

Much later in the 1930s when the Sungei Buloh Leprosarium was built, leprosy patients from the various camps were brought into the Sungei Buloh leprosarium and the leper population at the time was around 3000 lepers.
However over the years, the number has reduced and by 1980 , there were 1473 patients and in 2010, there are only 239 patients and ex patients.
In the early stages, Sungei Buloh Leprosarium was surrounded by barbed wire fencing, to deter the lepers from escaping. The Government did its best to provide the lepers with whatever medicines were available including opium and with limited food and clothing. The lepers were helpless, physically suffering with little food and tattered clothes. They had nothing to look forward to, but just lingering death.
TAN SRI T H TAN, FOUNDER & FIRST PRESIDENT OF MaLRA
The late Senator Tan Sri T H Tan, one of the main members of the Hon. The Prime Minister Tuanku Abdul Rahman’s team in securing Independence for Malaya from the British in 1957, was at that time extremely involved in politics and other activities of National importance.
Busy as he was, Tan Sri T H Tan was so struck by the sufferings of these lepers, he decided that immediate help must be given to these poor suffering leprosy patients.
He therefore got together a handful of like mind personalities and founded the Malaysian Leprosy Relief Association (MaLRA) in 1959.
AIM OF MaLRA
The basic aim of MaLRA is to provide financial relief to the leprosy patients, ex patients and their families. To this aim, MalRA and all MaLRA Branches have been successfully assisting patients financially as well as with amenities.
Some of the amenities that both MaLRA HQ and all its MaLRA Branches provide to the MalRA patients are : wheelchairs, tongkats, walkers, artificial limbs, spectacles, sewing machines, cataract operation, house repair, bicycles, fishing nets, garden tools, school fees, books, uniforms, transport, bus fares, opening small business, cash relief and food parcels, rehabilitation services to patients which include social, medical, and vocational assistance.
TUN DATO’ SERI ABDUL HAMID OMAR, PAST PRESIDENT MaLRA
After the Presidency of MaLRA passed into the hands of Tun Abdul Hamid Omar, the former Lord President of the Malaysian Judiciary, it passed through a momentous period of growth expansion.
Tun Dato’ Seri Abdul Hamid Omar, whilst at the pinnacle of power and prestige as Lord President of the Supreme Court of Malaysia, was also moved by the plight of thousands of sufferers afflicted with the scourge of leprosy. His humanitarian instincts prompted him to find ways to alleviate the sufferings of these unfortunate people. Tun decided to go “hands on” to help these poor unfortunate people.
Firstly, the thrust was setting up Branches. MaLRA now has Branches in almost all the States including Sabah and Sarawak.
Secondly, as MaLRA relied purely on Government aid, the aim was to make MaLRA self –sufficient. Tun then made efforts to consolidate MalRA ‘s resources.
Thirdly, the most difficult of all was to coax the ex-patients to come out of their self imposed shyness and the feeling of being ostracized by Society. There had been a gradual improvement in this area. Through the efforts of MaLRA, these ex-patients have been taken to shopping complexes, on sightseeing tours, and even to five star hotels, where functions such as hamper distributions to patients are held during Hari Raya, Chinese New Year, Deepavali festivals.", mleprosy@hotmail.com ,Malaysia Leprosy Relief Association (MALRA),http://malra.org.my,,

The Society is established for the relief and care of Malaysian children suffering from cancer and their families irrespective of race, religion and creed; and the advancement of research and public education in the prevention, control, diagnosis and treatment of childhood cancer.  Sarawak Children’s Cancer Society (SCCS) is a non-profit voluntary organisation formed on 26th September, 1999 by a group of parents of children with cancer to discover ways in which they could help each other and their children.
Formally registered in 26th November, 2001, SCCS expanded her role in provision of financial and emotional support, accommodation for outstation families and treatment facilities based on the incidence of new cases of childhood cancer which reaches 60 to 70 patients a year.
As more children began to survive with improved treatment techniques, public education about childhood cancer, quality of life and future prospects for children with cancer were recognized as increasingly important. From the initial group of a few concerned parents, the Society’s membership has now grown to include people from all over Sarawak who share the Society’s aims and concerns.",administrator@sccs.org.my,Sarawak Children Cancer Society (SCCS),http://sccs.org.my,,

",Health,+603  2094 1190 ,,"The abuse of drugs is one of the most significant health, social and economic issues facing the world today. The devastation caused by the abuse of tobacco, alcohol, prescription drugs, inhalants, cannabis, heroin, cocaine, amphetamines, ecstasy and other drugs is a major impediment to economic development and social cohesion.
Who are we
As the 1981 Kuala Lumpur IFNGO Joint Declaration acknowledges, substance abuse transcends ethnic, geographical, political, cultural and religious boundaries, and requires the active participation of the whole community for its control, reduction and eventual eradication (IFNGO, 1996).
Twenty years after the Kuala Lumpur Declaration, it is cause for great concern that these issues are still a major challenge to the global community. Non-government Organisations throughout the world play a leading role in preventing and treating drug abuse. Through the IFNGO, non-government Organisations can share ideas and learn from others’ experiences to create a safer world.
The IFNGO has demonstrated leadership and direction on these issues through its biennial conferences and ASEAN NGO workshops. At its 10th IFNGO ASEAN Workshop it agreed to a number of wide ranging resolutions, which are outlined in Appendix C. Importantly, the workshop resolved to create an ASEAN-NGO Clearinghouse on the Prevention of Drug Abuse, Treatment, Rehabilitation and Research.
At subsequent workshops IFNGO voiced its support for the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (11th IFNGO Workshop, refer Appendix D) and emphasised the importance of maximising the use of Indigenous sports and the Arts as alternative strategies for drug abuse prevention (12th IFNGO Workshop, refer Appendix E).
At its 18th International Conference in Brisbane, Australia, IFNGO outlined its shared vision and way forward. The Recommendations from the 2000 ASEAN Workshop and the Learning’s and Way Forward for IFNGO July 2000 are at Appendix F.
One of the agreed Ways Forward from the 18th IFNGO Conference related to leadership in advocating policies and implementing best practice. It was agreed that IFNGO should develop a common policy statement.
This policy statement recognises that each country has begun the process of addressing the enormous issue of the abuse of drugs and that many member countries are at a different stage of development of a national response.

Formerly known as the Ronald McDonald Children’s Charities Fund of Malaysia (RMCC), the Ronald McDonald House Charities Malaysia (RMHC Malaysia) was established in Malaysia in February 1990. Our main goal has always been to lend a helping hand to less fortunate children for a brighter future. Our main focus are in three areas : health, education and welfare.
The first Ronald McDonald House in the ASEAN region was established in 1999 and is located at the Pusat Perubatan Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia (formerly known as Hospital Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia), this “home away from home” is to provide temporary accommodation to families who make the journey to Kuala Lumpur for various medical treatments for their children at the hospital.
In 1997, RMHC Malaysia started TUNAS WAWASAN. The program is designed to financially assist students with academic potential from low income families. First began in the Federal Territory of Kuala Lumpur, this program has now expanded nationwide.
Our services
Every year, RMHC Malaysia organises various functions during festive seasons to enable children in welfare homes to be part of the festivities that other children may take for granted.
Various donations are also made throughout the year to help financial-distressed parents meet medical expenses for their children or to children whose families have experienced natural catastrophes.
RMHC Malaysia also manages the Gift of Smile that provides FREE corrective surgeries for children born with cleft lip and palate. The Gift of Smile is in partnership with Pantai Hospital Kuala Lumpur and McDonald’s Malaysia.
The Ronald McDonald Sensory Room is another project for children with special needs. RMHC Malaysia donates imported multi-sensory equipment to non-profit organisations that help special children.",rmhc@my.mcd.com,Ronald McDonald Children’s Charities Fund of Malaysia (RMCC),http://rmhc-malaysia.my,,

5. Self sustaining project
(Undertaken by Kasih Place (Kasih Laman Sdn bhd)
As a non profit charity organisation, Kasih Foundation depends on public support. However, public fund-raising is labour intensive and taxing on the public who are already facing financial challenges. Kasih Laman Sdn Bhd was therefore established to manage and operate Kasih Place to fund Kasih Hospice’s free-of-charge services and other free community services of the Foundation. In this way, the Foundation aims to enable KHC and its public-serving activities to enjoy a higher degree of self-funding and self-sustenance.", manager@kasihfoundation.org,Kasih Foundation,http://www.kasihfoundation.org/,,

In the 1950s the British Red Cross Society further established Branches in the other parts of Malaysia starting in Penang in 1950, and later in the other States.
Upon Malaya’s independence in 1957, the Branches in Peninsular Malaysia were organized as the Federation of Malaya Red Cross Society, which later was statutorily incorporated by the Federation of Malaya Red Cross Society (Incorporation) Act, 1962. MRCS received official recognition as an independent National Society from the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) on 4th July 1963 and accordingly was admitted as a member of the International League of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies on 24th August 1963 .
When Malaysia was formed in September 1963, an Act to incorporate the Federation of Malaya Red Cross Society and the Branches of the Red Cross Society in Sabah and Sarawak under the name of the Malaysian Red Cross Society was passed by Parliament via the Malaysian Red Cross Society (Incorporation) Act 1965. In 1975, the Malaysian Parliament passed the Malaysian Red Cross Society (Change of Name) Act which received Royal Assent on 21st August 1975 and subsequently gazetted on 4th Sept 1975 and is currently being enforced.

The mission of the Malaysian AIDS Council is to represent, mobilise and strengthen non-governmental organisations and communities to ensure political commitment and effective response in a supportive environment at national and local levels. In scaling up its unified efforts, the Malaysian AIDS Council will work in partnership. With government, private sector, international organisations and people living with HIV.
The Malaysian AIDS Council (MAC) was established in 1992 as an initiative of the Ministry of Health to be an umbrella organisation of NGOs working on HIV/AIDS issues. The aim of setting up the Council was to maximise the community response to HIV/AIDS and to ensure efficient use of limited resources. The Council, which initially consisted of 18 NGOs, has since grown to 42 in 2008.
Our membership
Membership of the MAC is open to all registered NGOs and societies which are interested and involved in HIV-related activities. These Partner Organisations (POs) range from community-based grassroot Sorganisations and faith-based organisations (FBOs) that work solely on HIV-related activities to large professional associations, national organisations with a primary focus other than HIV and FBOs. In the past, many of these NGOs were centred in Kuala Lumpur and other large cities. In recent years, in response to the epidemic, several community-based NGOs have emerged in smaller and rural areas including in East Malaysia. Most of these focus their activities in providing care and support to those who are HIV infected.
In the early years, much of MAC’s activities focused on advocacy and raising awareness of the AIDS epidemic in Malaysia to increase commitment of political leaders and of government, corporate and community leaders as well as strengthen prevention efforts. In a largely conservative society, HIV and especially related issues of sex, drug use and same sex relationships were and remain difficult topics to discuss and to act upon. Since the early 1990s as the epidemic grew more visible, MAC has increased its focus on the provision of care and support to those infected. Another significant activity of MAC through its sister organisation, the Malaysian AIDS Foundation (MAF), has centred on fundraising which has also been contributing to increasing awareness of HIV/AIDS in the community.
A more concerted effort towards prevention, treatment, care and support programmes was made possible in 2003 when MAC secured funding from the government for its activities. With this fund, MAC was able to co-ordinate and manage prevention, care and support activities that were designed and proposed by the POs in response to local needs. Each year, MAC’s annual plans were developed from these individual proposals submitted by the POs without a Strategic Plan to guide its actions and activities. As a result, although effective results were seen, many of these projects and activities were one-off projects with limited impact.
In 2007, in response to the government’s National Strategic Plan on HIV/AIDS and the increased burden of the epidemic and the government’s National Strategic Plan on HIV/AIDS, it became evident that MAC needed to formulate its own Strategic Plans to provide clear directions for the organisation to scale up to effectively respond to these new challenges and in line with the government’s National Strategic Plan on HIV/AIDS. The increased burden of the epidemic, the increased funding that has been made available through the Ninth Malaysia Plan, the larger geographic scope of MAC’s reach, and the increased expectations on MAC as the leading organisation in the country to respond to the epidemic led to the realisation that a comprehensive Strategic Plan that will guide the unified efforts of MAC Secretariat and MAC POs was crucial in moving the agenda forward in a cohesive, comprehensive and effective manner. At the end of 2007, MAC took the steps to begin the process of formulating its Strategic Plan for 2008-2010.",contactus@mac.org.my,Malaysian AIDS Council,http://www.mac.org.my/,,

Currently, YOKUK provided services to approximately 3,300 registered clients free of charge at our own centre in Jalan Padang Tembak, Pengkalan Chepa.

We provide all kinds of therapy services, welfare services and also vocational training.
YOKUK aims to build on the spirit of a caring society through its CBR (Community-based Rehabilitation) Program. The underlying structure of the CBR Program is founded upon the principles that the local community, in which the disabled people reside, has the duty and responsibility to assist them to fully realize their equal rights as citizens and human beings.
Therefore, the clients registered with YOKUK are with their family at their home. They only come to YOKUK daily for therapy program, workshop, vocational class or any other activities organised by YOKUK. For clients who come from poor families or live in impoverished rural areas hence can’t afford to come to our centre, YOKUK will visit them at their homes.

Our History
As a result of 1972 St. John Ambulance (Incorporation) Act, St. John Council were formed in every state. This movement marks the new beginning of the organization and St. John Ambulance is about to enter new era.
SJAM-SDE was officially segregated from SJAM Wilayah Persekutuan in year 1990.
The appointed first State Commander of SJAM-SDE was Dr. Chen Soo-See. He continued his service until year 1998 and was replaced by Mr Ho Thiam Hock. Mr. Ho was transferred from National Headquarters and was appointed as new State Commander of SJAM-SDE. Under his command and along with Mr Yeo Kim Thong as Deputy State Commander cum Hon. State Secretary, SJAM-SDE saw changes in administration and re-demarcation of certain Areas.
In 2004, Mr Yeo Kim Thong was appointed as State Commander and under his leadership more projects and changes were implemented to improve and benefit the Area HQs, officers & members.

We are a non-profit organization that gives families afflicted by rare genetic disorders access to genome sequencing and expert analysis. We bring together scientists who share our passion for helping rare disease patients and leverage the crowdfunding capabilities of the Internet to bring the hope of a cure to our patients.
Why We Care
An estimated 250 million people worldwide suffer from rare diseases. However, because each individual disease affects such a small number of people, little funding is used to study these conditions. Consequently, these patients are left with neither hope of a cure nor understanding of the disease. Each day is a living struggle for them to find a social identity in a world where they feel socially neglected and lost.
What We Do
Because most rare diseases are genetic in nature, we believe that genome sequencing has the power to help these patients in a way that conventional diagnostics cannot. However, most families affected with rare diseases are under financial strain, making access to such technologies difficult. To address this need, we act as a hub to help families raise funds and connect them to scientists who can help them.
How We Do It
We recruited a number of researchers and clinicians from top research institutions around the world. Through us, patients can gain access to world-class genomic sequencing and interpretation services at a much lower cost compared to commercially-equivalent solutions. We also provide a fundraising platform to help patients raise funds.
Where the Funds Go
We are a 501(c)(3) not-for-profit organization, funded primarily through the generosity of donors who believe in our cause. 100% of donated funds go directly to supporting patient-specific research. We also raise funds through other means, such as grants from academic institutions, foundations, private donations, and other financial sponsors. We are incredibly thankful to everyone who has given us their support and made it possible for us to do what we do.",contact@raregenomics.org,Rare Genomics Institute,http://raregenomics.org/,,

1. To educate the people in healthy family planning and to provide facilities for scientific contraceptive, so that married couple may space or limit their families, and thus promote their happiness in married life and mitigate the evils of ill health and overcrowding.
2. To advocate and promote the establishment of Family Planning Centres, at which, in addition to the advice on scientific contraception, married women and those about to be married, with mutual respect of the husband or intended husband, can get advice on and, when necessary, treatment for any of the following:
Johor FPA is not only focusing on family planning activities, but also on reproductive health, routine medical check-up, youth and disseminating information on family planning, reproductive health, family life and HIV/AIDS.

Despite numerous campaigns supporting Kidney health, there are still many who neglect to care for their kidneys and there is an increasing number of locals who suffer from renal failure every year. These residents are either currently undergoing dialysis or waiting for a kidney transplant. The Sandakan Kidney Society, a non-government association established in 1997, is one of few remaining hopes for kidney patients. The Society aims to cater for as many patients as their dialysis centre can offer but due to lack of funding and limited machines, there are still many on waiting list. Thus, JCI Sandakan is raising fund through the Miss JCI Sandakan Pageant in the hope of buying more dialysis machines for the Society.
The Sandakan Kidney Society was founded in 1997, when there was a public need for dialysis treatment. The hospital could only then accommodate a handful of patients. Thus, the Persatuan Tarian Singa Kin Ket Sandakan headed by Mr Poon and Mr Vincent Chang mooted the idea of a Kidney Society and hence the Sandakan Kidney Society was formed with the assistance of Enc Abu Bakar, Pengarah for Duchess of Kent Hospital, Dr Peter Cheong and Dr Ng Bak Cheng, a Nephrologist.
And with the help of the Minister of Social Services, Datuk JCI Sen Raymond Tan and public donors, an abandoned Colonial government quarter at No, JKR 2037 at Jalan Bukit off Jalan Utara was turned into a dialysis centre equipped with a generator, reverse osmosis water filtration system, Dialysis machines, etc.

Objective: to provide Day Care Dialysis Treatment to poor and needy Malaysian Patients in the Ampang area
Full Time Staff: Four (Manager,Nurse and two assistants)
Every year over 2,000 Malaysians suffer End-Stage Renal Failure. Many of these Malaysians either cannot afford private hospital charges of between RM150 and RM250 per treatment session (up to RM2,000 per month) or cannot obtain treatment in government hospitals. Furthermore, these Malaysians (often elderly) may have problems getting transport to dialysis centres (dialysis must be obtained every other day).
Dialysis is a permanent fact of life for these Malaysians as there is no cure for End Stage Renal Failure, except through a transplant.
Our objective
The objective of PMKL is to make Dialysis Treatments more easily available to average Malaysians by opening more Dialysis Centres in more areas and providing treatment at as low a cost as possible.
The inaugural PMKL Centre in Ampang now has 10 Dialysis Machines (maximum capacity is 18 machines), which can provide for up to 60 patients a day. PMKL Patients are charged the minimal cost of RM60 per visit. Comfortable sofa chairs and TVs are provided for patients as treatments take a long time. Treatments of medication are charged to patients at cost and a doctor’s services are provided free of charge to patients (doctor’s fees are borne by PMKL).
There is easy access to the PMKL centre from any Bus / Public Transport and there is parking in the shopping centre in which the centre is located.
Our needs

It costs RM20,000 to run the centre per month, which is all raised through fundraising. The sole government subsidy is RM50 per treatment (the same subsidy is received by the National Kidney Foundation and other NGOs dialysis centre).
We need volunteers: Medical staff (doctors, nurses, therapists)
We welcome volunteers in organising fundraising projects. Also, if you are interested in helping patients with transport to and from the centre in Plaza Ampang, please contact us.
We also welcome donations of medical equipment – please contact us for details.
PMKL needs to constantly raise funds to subsidise the cost of dialysis treatment and to open more centres for patients. Any donations are very welcome. Cheques Made Payable to: Pertubuhan Medifund Kuala Lumpur

When Established:     09/1993
FOCUSED’s objectives are :-
1. To uplift the quality and standard of living among the poor.
2. To transform the mindset of the poor towards self-reliance and development of their own communities.
FOCUSED is in contact with over 30 villages under its Orang Asli community development programmes. They have adopted 1 low-cost flats community as their urban community building project. Its programmes include Teens’ Service Centre (serving the young people from 12-18 years old), Teens’ Voice Centre (serving the young people above 18), Single Parents Support Group (in the early stages of identifying and providing services). FOCUSED plans to develop parental and self-help support groups in the community.
It is recognised that the low-cost community is ill equipped to face the rapid progress of urbanisation. The youths are particularly vulnerable to a wide array of social problems such as drug addition, lack of respect for parents and teachers, truancy, gangsterism and poor academic performance. Parents usually are too-stressed to cope with the market-oriented forces of urbanisation which inevitably result in broken family units. The incidence of social disorders such as crime, drug addictions and school dropouts are unusually high.
In its effort to meet the need of the squatter communities in Selayang, FOCUSED are working with schools, providing motivation programmes to the students, networking with the parents of the students and helping to facilitate parent support groups. FOCUSED hopes that with a support system that connects teacher, student, parent, community and the civil society, the squatter community will be better equipped to face the challenges of urbanisation.
FOCUSED also has grass-root community programmes amongst the poorest of the poor, that is the Orang Asli community. Its programmes consist of educational classes, establishing income generating enterprises, micro-financing and building of basic infrastructure.
The vision of FOCUSED is to empower the poor to develop their own marginalised community by using a holistic development of mobilising, training and partnerships. To this end, it works with governmental agencies, NGOs, corporate bodies and members of the public.
Approach:
1. Working alongside the poor, and being a partner to their development.
2. Spending the time nurturing their skills and potentials.
3. Motivating them to participate in their own community building.
4. Providing training tailored to the needs of the community.
Estimated Monthly Expenditure:     about RM180,000 per year
NEEDS
Volunteer services required for projects. Please contact organisation directly for more information.
FOCUSED is in need of financial support to cover its annual expenditure as follows:-
About RM140,000 a year is needed to cover cost of its programmes such as :-
* Community organisation
* Social development services
* Housing projects
* Micro-financing for the community
* Establish income generating businesses for the community
* Education
* Environmental awareness
Another RM40,000 is needed to cover costs such as:-
* Printing and stationery
* Staff training
* Office rental
* Research and Studies

812,"Department of Pediatric, Universiti Malaya Medical, Care Centre, 59100 Kuala Lumpur",Children/Health,+603 7950 2065,Prof Lucy Lum,"Who are we

The Paediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU) in Pusat Perubatan Universiti Malaya (PPUM) is a tertiary referral centre for critically ill children. The unit has eight beds and is staffed by two full-time paediatric intensive care consultants, three trainee paediatric medical officers and 22 nursing staff.
Four hundred children are admitted each year from Petaling Jaya, Kuala Lumpur, Klang, Banting and rural areas of Selangor, Perak, Pahang and Negeri Sembilan. The children who are admitted are those who are at risk of dying but have the chance to recover fully if appropriate care is given soon enough. Appropriate care for these children include the use of costly medical technology to support and monitor the function of failing body systems, as well as the expertise of paediatric intensive care medical and nursing staff.
Our services
The PPUM Paediatric Critical Care Fund has the aim of purchasing equipment to support these ill children until they recover the functions of the body. It is hoped that a portion of the fund will also be used to subsidise the cost of care of critically ill children from the economically disadvantaged background.
A nitric oxide delivery system was  purchased with a public donation drive sponsored by The Star in 2001 (Sunday Star February 25 2001) and there is a need for a second nitric oxide delivery system for newborn babies.
Our objectives
The new Paediatric Complex houses a 20-bedded PICU. With this, we hope to establish a retrieval service for critically ill children. Currently, children who are referred to us from other hospitals are transported in ambulances inadequately equipped to care for these ill children in transit. Furthermore, personnel from referring hospitals are not experienced in the transport of these ill children and many a mishap occur en route from peripheral hospitals to the tertiary centre. With a retrieval service, the paediatric intensive care transport team comprising of an experienced doctor and a nurse and other paramedical staff will travel to the location of the child (usually a peripheral hospital), to perform stabilisation and retrieval. This type of services is routinely available in Australia, United States of America, Canada, and the United Kingdom. Studies have shown that the retrieval system enhances the outcome of critically ill children.
Our needs
Volunteers are welcome. Please contact organisation for more information.
Description of Needs:
1) A servo-i ventilator which is used as a rescue therapy for children whose lungs are severely affected by an acute disease. This machine costs about RM110,000.
2) Pumps, costing RM5,000 each.

Thambirajah together with a group comprising 48 students of the Tamil Language Society and some lecturers of University of Malaya, Kuala Lumpur.
From its inception SMC formulated immediate and long-term objectives. SMC’s immediate concern was to prepare students for the STPM (Form Six) Examinations. Throughout the late 1970s and early 1980s the performance of Indian students in the STPM Examinations had begun to decline to the extent that there were insufficient adequately qualified Indian students to take up the seats allocated for Indian students in the local varsities.
Since the 1920’s middle-class Indian intelligence in Malaysia had recognised the importance of education for the improvement of the community. Social, religious, youth and political bodies has organised tuition classes for Indian children. The teachers were volunteers from the local community and the pupils came from around neighbourhood. The classes were held in either in Tamil schools, temples or the building of the association. The lessons ranged from academic guidance to Tamil language classes to Thevaram sessions. Unfortunately, the enthusiasm of the teachers and organisers were never sustained over a period of more than a few years. The classes were not regular, teachers failed to attend classes, financial problems surfaced and finally the classes were closed. SMC learnt lessons from the past efforts of these well-meaning, socially conscious Indians who made attempts but did not succeed in achieving their goals.
From the outset SMC created an administration that was centralised, structurally closely-knit, tightly coordinated and strictly supervised. Its organisation then, could easily be extended and coordinated nation-wide.
Academically SMC longed to offer the best for students preparing for STPM classes. Each subject was to have 25 lessons. Each lesson was written out by undergraduates and graduates under the supervision of University lecturers and experienced teachers. The lessons were supplemented by tutorials, seminars, model answers, tutorials and seminar packs, analysis from past year question papers, tips on study techniques, a personal study scheme, motivational talks with personalised care and attention.
Conducted any other way, the classes would have been subjected to the individual experience and whims of the teachers. It was conceived from the beginning that there would be run in exactly the same manner academically and administratively.
In brief, the belief of SMC was that if it cannot offer to the Indians something far better than what they are exposed to, then it better not offer anything. Again, SMC set itself the goal of wishing silently to produce results – “We need workers not talkers”. SMC prepared the material for the first STPM classes from September, 1982 to April. 1983. In April, 1983, 4 STPM classes were commenced at Petaling Jaya, Sentul, Klang and Seremban. Over the years the centres were expanded throughout the country.
Up till 2012, about 23,000 students who have studied in SMC classes have gained admission to local universities. Many more have passed the examinations and obtained promotions in the jobs or have gone overseas to further their studies.",srimurugancentre@gmail.com,Sri Murugan Center,http://www.smc.com.my/,,
860,"Kompleks MAB, Jalan Tebing Off Jln Tun Sambanthan 4 Brickfields,  50471 Kuala Lumpur",Differently Abled/Education,+603 22722 677,,"The Malaysian Association for the Blind (MAB) was established in November 21 1951 in order to look after the welfare of the blind in the country on the initiative of Major D.R. Bridges who was then an officer in the Department of Welfare Services of Malaya. He was a soldier in the British army in Burma and was blinded in the war during the 1940’s. After being rehabilitated in England, he was assigned to work as a welfare officer for the blind in Malaya. Subsequently, he became the first Executive Director of the MAB in the 1950’s.
After about 10 years of service in Malaya, he had helped to bring about important developments in the work for the blind in this country. In 1952 he obtained the British Resident, Sir Henry Gurney, to lay the foundation stone for Gurney Training Centre (GTC) at Jalan Marsh, Kuala Lumpur. Unfortunately, because of his assassination while on the way to Fraser’s Hill, the stone was laid instead by Sir Gerald Templer on December 18, 1952.
This was followed by the laying of the foundation stone for the Princess Elizabeth School for the Blind in Johor Baru to provide primary education for blind children. This took place on February 5, 1953 at its present site in Jalan Nong Chik but the school had actually been started in 1948 by the Social Welfare Department. In the same year of 1953, the GTC was also opened with an enrolment of five trainees.
Major Bridges went on to make applications for land from the state governments of Pahang and Perak. This led to the establishment of the Taman Harapan agricultural training centre for the rural blind in Temerloh, Pahang in 1958 with an enrolment of ten trainees. The establishment of the Kinta Valley Workshop in Ipoh, Perak was also brought in the same year of 1958 with enrolment of 20 to produce handicrafts for sale.
Major Bridges was also responsible for setting up the Job Placement Service in Kuala Lumpur in 1956 and for negotiating the handing over the Braille Publishing Unit and Braille Equipment Sales from the Ministry of Education to the MAB in 1959.
Thus, by the time he left Malaya in the early 1960’s, a firm and solid foundation had been laid for the work for the blind to continue in this country. Further developments that took place in the 1960’s and beyond included the establishment of the Sales Organisation for Basket Workers in 1967 with 20 clients, opening of the Rotary Hostel for Blind Workers in 1975 with assistance from the Rotary Club of Kuala Lumpur, starting of the MAB/UKM Low Vision Clinic in 1980 and the MAB Low Vision Resource Centre in 1988 and the implementation of the Community-Based Rehabilitation Programme (CBR) in Pahang in 1985 and in Negeri Sembilan in 1994. Many of these developments took place when the Prime Minister, YAB Tun Hussein Onn, was the President of MAB from 1975-1990.
Eventually, 1996 saw the completion of the new MAB Complex on the site of the former GTC building. The idea was to house the majority of the services in Kuala Lumpur under one roof. Thus, in 1997 the GTC, Braille Library, Placement Service and Headquarters moved into the complex which was officially opened by His Majesty, the Yang Di Pertuan Agong, Tuanku Ja’afar Ibni Almarhum Tuanku Abdul Rahman.
The new services in the MAB Complex included sports and recreational facilities such as the goalball centre, gymnasium and jogging track as well as a Pre-School Programme for Blind Children (ABC) started at the beginning of 1998 and the Elderly Blind Centre launched by the Welfare Chairman, Prof. Abdullah Malim Baginda, at the end of 1998. However, just one year before (in 1997), the Social Activity Centre for the adult blind was set up at the premises of the Rattan Centre at Jalan Berhala in Brickfields. Then in 1998 all the welfare services were categorised under the MAB Welfare Unit with a welfare officer to be in charge.
MAB has also endeavoured to meet the needs of the blind with regards to tertiary education and information technology. In 1970 the MAB initiated a scholarship fund to provide loans and grants to support the blind at the college and university level. A further boost was given to the fund when in 1991 the Institute of Engineers, Malaysia (IEM) made available an annual grant to the Tun Hussein Onn Memorial Scholarship Fund which was set up in that year. One of the beneficiaries of the scholarship fund is now for his doctorate degree at the University of Malaya.
With regards to I.T, computer literacy courses were first introduced to the GTC in 1989. This was followed by the establishment of the computer programming course for the blind in June 1992 with assistance from IBM, Malaysia. 1993 saw the First ASEAN Seminar on Computer Techology for the Blind organised by MAB in Kuala Lumpur. Subsequently, this has led to the setting up of the Cyber Cafe located at the MAB Complex and launched by the Deputy Prime Minister, Dato’ Seri Abdullah Ahmad Badawi on July 30, 2001.
The other main objective of MAB is, of course, blindness prevention and much work, therefore, has also been carried out in this field. This began with the launching of the prevention of blindness programmes in Selangor in 1969 and 1973 as well as in Terengganu in 1971 with the help of the Mobile Eye Clinic which was introduced in 1967. Financial and moral support were given by the Royal Commonwealth Society for the Blind (RCSB) in the United Kingdom and the Ministry of Health of Malaysia.
These efforts culminated in the establishment of the Tun Hussein Onn Eye Hospital for which a fund-raising campaign was launched in 1983 by the MAB President, YAB Tun Hussein Onn. In 1984 the foundation stone for the eye hospital was laid by His Highness, the Sultan of Selangor on September 22. His Highness also launched the hospital at its grand opening in 1987. Finally, in March 1996, the hospital attained national status and became known as the Tun Hussein Onn National Eye Hospital.
The MAB was very fortunate to have had a number of distinguished visitors. In 1998 alone, the three distinguished visitors included the Yang Di Pertuan Agong who visited and opened the MAB complex on September 11, Her Majesty, Queen Elizabeth II of Britain on September 23 and the DYMM Sultanah Kalsom of Pahang on November 12. In 2001 MAB had the honour of receiving two other distinguished visitors – Dato’ Seri Dr. Mahathir Mohammad, the Prime Minister on May 4 to initiate the Reading Programme for Blind Children and Dato’ Seri Abdullah Ahmad Badawi, Deputy Prime Minister, on July 30 to launch the Cyber Cafe for the blind. The MAB has also had the opportunity to share the lime-light with famous international pop artistes such as Cliff Richard who visited MAB in the 1960’s and Joe Feliciano who visited in the early 1990’s as well as Malaysian superstars such as Erra Fazira and Siti Nurhaliza who were MAB’s visitors in 2001 when they also took part in the Reading Programme.
Indeed, throughout the 50 years of its history, MAB has striven hard to continually upgrade and expand its programmes and develop new services for the blind and visually impaired as well as to bring benefits to the community at large through its blindness prevention activities. MAB has also endeavoured constantly to meet the changing needs and challenges posed by technological advancements.
On June 16, 2001 the MAB Council held a brainstorming session and there are plans to reach out to the blind all over the country with the establishment of branches and through local community centres which will be set up to provide the blind at the district and state level with recreational facilities, braille equipment and access to reading materials and information technology. MAB celebrated its fiftieth year on November 21, 2001 by holding a charity banquet on November 9, 2001.
We take this opportunity to place on record our heartfelt thanks for all the support and contributions to MAB made by friends and volunteers in cash, kind or service. We invite the public to join with us in our programme of activities and festivities with the view to bringing about greater awareness of the work that is being done by MAB in this country.
Our mission
To empower persons with visual impairment by providing them with services and opportunities for greater participation, involvement and integration into society as well as to promote prevention of blindness.

Bangsa Ria as a day-care centre for the disabled and mentally-challenged, was originally run by a church in Bangsar for some years. When the church decided to close down the centre in 2006, the children were literally left in the lurch. The staff too had no other place to go. The parents, despite having helped to raise funds had no recourse as the centre belonged to the church which had the legal right to close it down. Out of desperation, in the same year, parents and well-wishers came together and registered Persatuan Orang Kurang Upaya Bangsa Ria KL & Selangor (Bangsa Ria Association for the Disabled KL & Selangor) as a legal, registered society under the Registrar of Societies (registration no. 0873-06-SEL).
Our children
Each child is different: some are autistic or display autistic behaviour. Others severely mentally challenged with various disabilities. One has Down’s.
Each has their own timetable of training activities to best develop their skills. The less mentally disabled have activities ranging from picture puzzles, colouring to simple writing, maths, beading and fixing blocks (hand-eye coordination). For others, even scooping food on a spoon and placing the spoon into the mouth is a fantastic skill, as is indicating that they need to use the toilet.
Each child has a time period in the Snoezelen Room which is a safe, fun, cool sensory stimulation area which even normal kids (and adults) love!
We celebrate all the children’s birthdays and festivals. Many of our children may not be able to speak but they know, understand and respond to love, kindness, joy and genuine sincerity.
Our mission
Bangsa Ria offers a sanctuary for the disabled, providing individualised training to push each child to the best of their abilities. Training, mental and sensory stimulation, meals, snacks, friendship and above all, loving caring is at the core of Bangsa Ria.  Our centre opens from 8:30 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., Mondays to Fridays. Each child has a separate training programme based on individual assessment. The skills and therapeutic training activities include:
Our fund-raising activities
Almost every year, we organise a jumble sale at our premises. This sale has a 3-fold function. One, we raise funds. Two, we raise public awareness of our centre in the media. Three, we price most items at very low figures and sometimes give them away. As many customers come from the lower income bracket and some are foreign workers, this is our contribution to society in thanks for the many kindnesses shown to us.
We also take part in the annual Austrian-German-Swiss (AGS) Christmas Bazaar selling items made by generous contributors. AGS too has become a very kind contributor to our centre.
Apart from selling items made by others, we cannot do much as our children are too severely mentally disabled to make things on their own.
Our needs
Bangsa Ria collects a monthly contribution of RM400/- per child, who are provided with breakfast, lunch and tea. Our monthly outgoings total near to RM10,000/-.
We need to emphasise here that only the staff are paid. The committee members receive no allowance whatsoever for their work whether administrative, travelling or any other expenses incurred. In fact, we often pay out of our own pockets even for treats for the children, stationery or postage.
At Bangsa Ria, age is not a factor, nor religion, nor race. Our doors are open to all and we are strictly secular. We accept every disabled person who wants our help and we welcome every kind of help, in cash, kind and time. Please make all cheques payable to: Persatuan Orang Kurang Upaya Bangsa Ria KL Dan Selangor. Our Bangsa Ria children (they are all children in mind, though the oldest is 39) may not always be able to show their appreciation of your contributions. Rest assured, we, the staff and parents, will. Thank you for reaching out to our children. Thank you on behalf of Bangsa Ria.
Our Dream
1. To have a permanent place of our own.
2. A benefactor to cover our monthly excess expenditure.
3. A caring corporate foundation to take over the Centre, as eventually, parents would not be around to see to our children’s welfare.
Our current situation
Bangsa Ria faces the problem of having to find a new premise in the near future as the owner of the present premise is asking for the property back. The Centre also have problems trying to get its Snoozelen Room equipment repaired. The room is a place of dazzling colors, sounds and images, built to stimulate the minds of the children, and to promote their sensory skills of touch, sight and sound.

Anda mungkin tidak merasa penderitaan anak-anak kecil ini, tetapi percayalah di sanubari mereka tersimpan perasaan untuk mendapat belaian kasih seorang bapa yang telah pergi buat selama-lamanya.
Malahan, ada juga di kalangan penghuni di Rumah Anak-Anak Yatim Darul Aminan (Darul Aminan) di Ampangan, di sini tidak mendapat perlindungan sewajarnya sebelum ini kerana kesempitan hidup dan mereka mengharapkan simpati masyarakat untuk menentukan hala tuju hidup mereka.
Namun begitu, Darul Aminan yang dibangunkan sejak Januari 2006 kini menjadi penyambung kehidupan mereka, malahan kanak-kanak kurang bernasib baik itu kini dijaga, dibelai, dimanjai seperti anak-anak penjaga mereka sendiri.
Apa tidaknya, Darul Aminan kini menempatkan seramai 37 penghuni berusia setahun sehingga 16 tahun yang merupakan anak-anak yatim daripada keluarga miskin di Negeri Sembilan.
Bukan dipaksa atau diheret ke situ, tetapi anak-anak yatim ini melangkah ke Darul Aminan atas kerelaan sendiri demi masa depan yang lebih baik walaupun terpaksa berpisah dengan ibu dan adik-beradik yang lain.
Di sinilah kehidupan baru mereka bermula apabila Darul Aminan menjadi ‘rumah’ untuk berlindung dan mencipta masa depan yang lebih baik.
Begitupun di sebalik pengharapan baru yang diberikan di Darul Aminan kepada setiap penghuninya, pusat penjagaan tersebut tetap bergelumang dengan kemelut tersendiri.
Percaya atau tidak, Darul Aminan sejak beroperasi digerakkan dengan tulang empat kerat pasangan suami isteri, Kamalul Arifin Abu Kassim, 47, dan Ruzita Abdul Aziz, 44, yang bergelar ‘ayah’ dan ‘mama’ kepada para penghuninya.
Bukan itu saja, sejak ditubuhkan Darul Aminan yang sudah didaftarkan di bawah Pertubuhan Anak Yatim Darul Aminan Negeri Sembilan tidak mendapat apa-apa bantuan daripada kerajaan, sebaliknya bergantung sepenuhnya kepada sumbangan ihsan orang ramai yang tidak putus-putus menghulurkan bantuan.
Rumah yang menjadi tempat kanak-kanak tersebut bernaung juga berada dalam keadaan serba kekurangan sekali gus memerlukan penambahbaikan.
Pada ketika ini, pertubuhan tersebut terpaksa menyewa di tiga buah rumah di Jalan Gedong Lalang 8 Ampangan, di sini untuk menempatkan penghuni yang terdiri daripada 16 perempuan dan 21 lelaki dengan kadar sewa RM350 sebuah.
Menurut Kamalul Arifin yang juga Pengasas dan Pengerusi Darul Aminan, mereka memerlukan kawasan sendiri yang mempunyai keluasan sekurang-kurangnya 1.2 hektar untuk membina bangunan bagi penghuninya.
“Pada masa sekarang penghuni harus tinggal berasingan di tiga buah rumah yang diubah suai menjadi asrama. Alangkah bagus jika mereka ditempatkan di satu tempat demi keselesaan mereka menjalankan pelbagai aktiviti.
“Bukan itu saja, setiap tahun semakin ramai yang memohon ke sini tetapi terpaksa ditolak kerana rumah ini tidak cukup untuk menampung penghuni yang ramai,” jelasnya.
Tambah Kamalul Arifin, hasrat untuk memiliki bangunan dan kawasan sendiri pernah diajukan kepada pihak tertentu namun mendukacitakan kerana sehingga kini tiada mendapat apa-apa jawapan.
“Kami tidak mahu terlalu mendesak sesiapa untuk menghulurkan bantuan melainkan mereka yang ikhlas ingin menghulurkan bantuan dengan mewakafkan tanah atau bangunan demi masa depan anak-anak yatim ini,” ujarnya.
Kata Kamalul Arifin, beliau kini bertambah bingung memikirkan kontrak rumah sewa tersebut yang dijangka tamat pada penghujung tahun ini.
Keperluan kami
“Perbelanjaan bulanan dianggarkan lebih RM5,000 sebulan tetapi namanya anak yatim rezeki mereka sentiasa ada, hasil derma orang ramai termasuk syarikat korporat yang tidak pernah bermusim.
“Begitu juga dengan tenaga pengajar yang mengendalikan pelbagai kelas di sini, mereka melakukan dengan sukarela,” katanya.

To develop a non-profit organisation to help the Down Syndrome children.
Our aim is to create and pervade the awareness regarding the integration of individuals with Down syndrome into the society. We hope to assist and educate individuals with Down syndrome to enable them to become more independent adults who could lead meaningful lives.
Who we are
We started as a small support group of parents who sent their children to Kiwanis’s Early Intervention Centre. With guidance and support from the Kiwanis members and teachers, we started to form our society, Down Syndrome Society of Johor. We are the first association created specifically to support the cause of individuals with Down syndrome established at the state level. Following from the success of this organization, there are now currently 8 such State-level associations in Malaysia.
Our mission
Our mission is to uncover the talent and to optimize the potential of individuals with Down syndrome through education and holistic support, and to work seamlessly with all parties to achieve this end.
Our motto
“Because of LOVE, We Forge Ahead Together”
What we do
At the Association of Down Syndrome Johor, we continuously strive to improve the lives of individuals with Down syndrome through various initiatives and activities. The core of everything we do is providing help to our members and all those who surround people with Down syndrome, their families, carers and other relevant professionals.
We established PLAK (Program Latihan Asas Kerjaya), a basic vocational skills training centre in 2007 in order to equip children and teenagers with Down syndrome with skills which will help them in finding a job in future. It has been a success, as we have witnessed marked achievements among the participants of these programs.
Following on the success of PLAK, we are establishing a Career Centre for Down Syndrome (CCENDS) in 2010, which we hope will provide further career training as well as job opportunities for individuals with Down syndrome. It is our hope that these special people will one day be full-fledged members of the society who could stand on their own two feet with minimal support.

Youth are the future of our Nation. Yet many needy and the less privileged Youth, particularly those in the rural areas, are being left out from the mainstream of education and other opportunities. They are pleading to you and your organization to take them into consideration.
In answer to their plights, the Brothers of St. Gabriel established its first foundation known as Montfort Boys Town (MBT) in Shah Alam, Selangor in 1959. The demand for places had prompted the Brothers to reach out and establish Centres in Sabah and Melaka.
“A Home Truly Dear for Needy Youth” was established in Sabah in June 1999 on a 1.1-acre site in Donggongon, Penampang, starting with 15 Trainees on makeshift facilities. Gradually, the number increased to 70. With the steady support of the public, the corporate sectors, individual donors and Charitable Foundations, this humble beginning had begun to bear fruits after having equipped many Youth with character formation, technical skills, discipline, spiritual and moral values for dignified living.
Journey So Far
From 15 boys Trainees in 1999, we have 120 boys and 30 girls in our campus today. From 1.1-acre site in Donggongon, Penampang, we moved into a bigger site of 10.86 acres at Kinarut, where we have a residential campus, a skill development campus that hosted 4 workshops.
Our vision
A home truly dear for those whom the world neglects.
Our Mission
To develop Youth to their full potential
Our Aims and Objectives
The aims of Montfort are two-pronged, namely Character Formation and Skill Training. Being competent in skill is balanced with being disciplined in character so that the Youth are ready for gainful employment and become vibrant nation builders.
The objectives of Montfort are three-facet, namely –
• To provide residential care for Youth under its training programme
• To provide guidance and accompaniment for integral human development
• To provide foundational education and industrial skills development
Our Approach
MYTC’s two-year residential programme teaches living skills and is tailored to instil discipline, guidance, spiritual formation, soft skills and leadership skills. Our challenge is to cultivate the importance of good attitudes and positive traits which will sustain them as resourceful persons for their families, communities and society.

Kembalinya Allahyarham Tun Abdul Razak (Memorial Tun Razak) ke rahmatullah pada 14 Januari 1976 mengejutkan semua pihak kerana tiada siapa tahu penyakit yang dihidapi beliau. Ramai berpendapat bahawa cara terbaik untuk mengenang jasa Tun ialah dengan menubuhkan sebuah yayasan yang boleh menyambung dan meneruskan perjuangan murni beliau. Justeru, pada 20 Februari 1976, di satu majlis anjuran akhbar ‘The New Straits Times’, sebuah yayasan telah dilancarkan oleh YBM Tengku Razaleigh Hamzah, Menteri Kewangan Malaysia ketika itu. Yang Amat Arif Tun Mohamed Suffian, Ketua Hakim Negara ketika itu dilantik sebagai Pengerusi Lembaga Pemegang Amanah Yayasan Tun Razak yang pertama. Dalam masa sama, beberapa institusi lain turut dirancang dan ditubuhkan dengan tujuan yang sama. Untuk mengelakkan kekeliruan serta salah faham, Kerajaan Malaysia telah menubuhkan sebuah jawatankuasa yang dipengerusikan oleh Menteri Kewangan pada Mac 1976 untuk menyatukan institusi-institusi berkenaan. Justeru, pada Julai 1976, satu rang undang-undang telah diluluskan oleh Parlimen dan seterusnya diperkenankan oleh Seri Paduka Baginda Yang Di Pertuan Agong pada 28 Oktober 1976. Rang Undang-undang tersebut dikenali sebagai Akta Yayasan Tun Razak.

We prepare them to sit for the Government examinations. We need approximately RM40,000 monthly to run this Centre.
Feeding Ministry
As the vision expands, we have also set up a department to provide provisions and other help 
to the following groups of people in need:
The Orang Asli groups in Pahang, Kelantan, Perak and Selangor.
Current Plan
We are looking forward to start building the Girls’ Home soon. This will also be a 3 storey building on a piece of corner lot land just opposite the current Boys’ Home. We need approximately RM1.5 million for the building.
Future Plan
Our future plan is to acquire a piece of land about five (5) acres to build a multi-purpose complex where all the community services will be available e.g. The Children’s Home, Day Care Centre, Youth Centre, Food distribution Centre to the poor, services to the single parents, old folks, a Community Clinic and also an Administration Office.

What we do

1. To provide day care and education for the severely mentally disabled children and youths, aged two to 19 years who belong to one or more of the following categories:-
2. To promote and stimulate research concerning severely mentally handicapped persons and to develop locally appropriate methods of treatment, education and vocational training.
3.To develop better public understanding and awareness, especially among parents and guardians, of the needs of children with severe mental retardation.
4.To raise funds to enable the Society to achieve its objectives.
History
The Society for the Severely Mentally Handicapped, Selangor and Wilayah Persekutuan is a voluntary welfare organisation established and registered with the Registrar of Societies in 1984 with the objective of providing rehabilitation facilities to children and youths with severe mental and physical (multiple) disabilities in Selangor and the Federal Territory. Following this objective, a Day Care and Training Centre was set up in June 1985.
The centre started with a small group of severely mentally disabled children and four staff. Today, the centre has 10 staff comprising an Administrator, a Physiotherapist, an Occupational Therapist, a Speech Therapist, five Teachers and a Housekeeper and an enrolment of 15 children in our Individual Education Program, and nine teens and young adults in our Living Skills Group.
Over the years the centre has expanded its programs from simple day care with some physical activities to the current program which aims to provide training to maximise the children’s functional skills including motor, cognitive, communication, social and self-help skills.
Working with the full-time staff are volunteers including paediatricians, home makers and representatives from religious and lay organisations – all of whom have dedicated invaluable time and services for the efficient running of the Centre.
Our services
Currently, rehabilitation services for the severely mentally disabled are being provided by both the Government and private voluntary organisations. However, it must be emphasised that not all centres cater to those with multiple disabilities. Hence the Society is focused on efforts to meet the needs of this category of disabled people.
Our needs
The Society requires an estimated RM 20,000 monthly to maintain and run the training centre. Funds for this centre comes from donations received from the general public as well as annual government grants and subsidies from the Department of Social Welfare. Funds are also raised through various fundraising activities which are organised several times a year. The generous support of many caring Malaysians has indeed gone a long way to help us make life more meaningful for these children.

Pusat Harian Kanak-kanak Spastic Ipoh (PHKKS) was formed in October 1988 (registration number 2967/88-Perak) with only  five disabled children. The prime aim of the centre is to provide free daycare services, education and training for spastic children. Four years later in 1992, the centre introduced and provided services to different categories such as down syndrome/mentally retarded children. The centre also started to house orphans, abandoned and poor children in the same year.
With initial contribution of RM1000.00 from the committee members, the centre then operated as daycare centre at the community hall in Kampong Pasir Putih Ipoh with a monthly rental of RM200.00. The hall was eventually donated to the centre (in 1992) by the late Yang Amat Berhormat Dato’ Seri Haji Wan Mohamed Bin Wan Teh. Yang Bahagia Datin Seri Hajjah Maria Binti Mahmud, wife of YAB then was appointed as life patron for the centre.
Mission
Today the centre has manpower of 12 taking care of 80 persons on its register. This includes down syndrome, mentally retarded children, spastic/disable children and youth. As a day care centre it helps the poor family members to continue working without having to worry about the care of their disabled children.
Apart from these categories, there are 30 poor and neglected old folks registered with the centre. Though they are not staying at the centre their welfare and basic needs are taken care by the centre. The committee members make a monthly visit to their respective homes to deliver kitchen provision to meet their basic needs. We provide financial and in-kind assistance to needy widows and single mothers. Also psychological support is provided through regular visits carried out by PHKKS staff.

Since 1973, we have made vast contributions towards the continual training and professional development of pre-school teachers in Malaysia.
History
PTM was initiated by Miss Constance White, an Education Ministry Official to address the urgent need to upgrade the standard of Malaysia’s pre-school education. The initial 160 member association, was established on 25th August 1973, and elected Sister Denise Paquette as its Chairman. Today, PTM continues to grow, provide and recruit members by providing enrichment education and healthcare activities not only for pre-school teachers but also for kindergarten operators and parents.
Our objectives
For Children
PTM strives to look into the physical, cognitive, emotional, moral and social development of pre-school children by working closely with the Ministry of Education on The National Pre-School Curriculum. Furthermore, PTM aims to contribute time and effort to upgrade facilities in the rural as well as the urban kindergartens through on-going seminars and art festivals to foster greater co-operation and understanding amongst operators and children of various kindergartens.
For Parents
Parents play a very important role in the overall development of their children. Recognizing this, PTM engages child experts and provides services such as talks on child related issues that will further enhance their parenting skills. It is also PTM’s aim to disseminate literature and any other information regarding pre-school education to parents and the public.
For Kindergarten Operators
PTM also provides professional advice to kindergarten operators on a wide range of issues, from setting up to day-to-day operations. Through this support, we aim to ensure that all kindergarten facilities provide a conducive learning environment.
For Pre-School Teachers
PTM places great emphasis on training to improve the quality of pre-school teachers. We develop training courses to equip pre-school teachers in the private sector with the necessary skills to meet the needs of young children. Our training course is in line with the National Pre-School Curriculum and continues to be the primary module used to train pre-school teachers. The Bi-Annual In-Service Course has also been extended to East Malaysia, and covers a broad range of topics, which include:
This course is attended by pre-school teachers as well as kindergarten operators, parents and those who are interested to work with children. As PTM is in their 38th anniversary, they strive for excellence in all areas of pre-school and healthcare education to create leaders for the future.",ptmkin@streamyx.com,Persatuan Tadika Malaysia (Malaysian Association of Kindergartens),http://www.facebook.com/Persatuan-Tadika-Malaysia-217595624975167,,

The drivers sought to promote international understanding and peace through student exchanges. In 1947, AFS exchanged 52 young people from 11 countries formerly at war.

About Yayasan Antarabudaya Malaysia
Each year, AFS Antarabudaya Malaysia sends more than 200 exchange students abroad for year, semester and short term programs (including programs that focus on language study and community service), and welcomes more than 100 exchange students from other countries to Malaysia.
While in Malaysia, students study in local high schools and live with host families to learn what it is like to live as a member of a family and community within our country.
AFS impact can be seen through the success of the former AFS participants. Many have achieved careers as diplomats, educators, business executives and involved members of their communities.

There are 250,000 people with special needs in Malaysia, one percent of its population of around 25 million. The country’s large proportion of young people means many of those with special needs are children. Dedicated therapies and care can help these physically, visually or mentally disabled children to meet their full potential. Tasputra Perkim, founded in the Malaysian capital of Kuala Lumpur in 1987, is a shining example of what is possible.
The centre is run from a government-owned house in a quiet but central part of the city. The 50 or so children who attend are mainly from lower-income Malaysian families living in the immediate area.
Such things don’t come cheaply – the centre always needs more money and equipment to meet its primary objective — which is to uplift the lives of the children in its care. Expert and non-expert volunteers and helpers are also of huge support to its ambitions.
Our services
The children’s families pay up to RM200 per month (US$66) towards the costs, depending on what they can manage.
At the same time, Tasputra Perkim staff and associates understand there is much more to be done to help special needs children throughout Peninsular and East Malaysia. In addition to securing the centre’s own future, they want to share their experiences and lessons with others involved in special needs issues and those wishing to launch similar ventures throughout the country.
Operation hours: The centre runs from 7.30 am to 5.00 pm every weekday and the office is open until 1.00 pm on Saturdays.
Staff:
Guided and headed by the chairman and co-founder, Mrs. Elahe Norman, there are 28 staff, 18 of whom are caregivers. The latter are trained to provide the children with special care in their feeding habits, exercise, personal training, behaviour management, hygiene and basic education. Others include a supervisor, physiotherapist, office administrator, cooks, drivers, a night-watch man and a gardener. We also get a number of local and foreign volunteers.
In-house training:
The staffs are constantly sent for training sessions. The Welfare Department gives courses in caring for special children, to which Tasputra sends its staff each week on a rotational basis. Various staff have also attended residential courses run in Ipoh by the Yayasan Idris Shah.
Fund Raising:
Tasputra runs almost entirely on donations and fundraising, receiving a government grant of only 19,000 ringgit ($5,000) a year. Our monthly expenses are 32,000 ($8,400) including staff salaries, maintenance of the house and vans, utility bills and food for the children.
We hold regular fund raisers such as jumble sales and bazaars hosted by hotels and societies. Tasputra invites people and associations from all walks of life to help in this charitable cause.

It was established in 1981 as the first special school in the state of Sabah for children whose special requirements could not be met in mainstream schools. It was a project initiated by a group of volunteers in collaboration with the Sabah Mental Health Association and established by a Board of Management. A footballers’ changing room at the Likas Sports Complex was used to start the first class for 10 children aged 6 to 12 years. The pioneer staff consisted of 3 teachers, a general helper, and a CUSO (Canada) volunteer worker as its first Principal.
In 1983, the school shifted to a government residential building which has a spacious compound and beautiful surroundings located in one of the choicest areas by the Tanjung Aru beach at Kota Kinabalu. The environment is very pleasant and the atmosphere rather personal and people friendly, without the usual feel of a welfare institution. Instead, it is very homely, much like the belief at Seri Mengasih that a school should be an extension of the home, and likewise, the home an extension of the school.
Over a span of 30 years, from a very humble beginning of a single class operating in a place which had to be vacated whenever there were soccer matches; Seri Mengasih developed into a special developmental centre at its present premises in Tanjung Aru, with a current enrolment of more than 150 students ranging from babies to young adults, and 25 staff.
Seri Mengasih seeks to raise the hope and dignity of the intellectually and developmentally disabled by providing for their holistic development from the earliest age until, as far as possible, they have achieved socio-economic independence and are successfully included and integrated into the mainstream of community life. This can only be done through the combined effort of the staff, parents and the general public.",serimengasih@yahoo.com.my,Seri Mengasih Centre (Kota Kinabalu),http://www.facebook.com/Seri-Mengasih-Centre-127534047319791,,

History
In November 1998, Asia Pacific Economy Co-operation ( APEC) was held in Malaysia. Then Asia Pacific People ( APPA ), a general public conference was held to discuss issues arising from the economic policy via the idea of globalisation of the APEC which would benefit the big corporations but neglect the people at large.
The APPA focused on issues such as human right, environment, food security and agriculture, media, privatization, arms trade and miniaturisation.
A group of students from various Malaysia Universities were in charge of the student sector on the affect of globalisation in youth and students in the APPA assembly. After the event , those students decided to establish and consolidate a pro democracy youth and student movement in Malaysia. Thus DEMA was formed in 17 September 1998.
Now, DEMA has a network involving various campuses in Malaysia enabling the youth and students to uphold the basic principles of campus democracy.

Who are we
CADS Enhancement Centre (CEC) or Pusat Pembangunan Potensi CADS is a non-profit organisation registered with Malaysian Registrar of Society (Reg. No. 1659-03-5). Formed in 2003 by a group of parents, academicians and individuals with interests in special needs children development.CADS Enhancement Centre also provides the necessary counselling and support group for the family and care-givers of CADS children.
Our goals
Our goals is to provide CADS’s children with equal opportunity to develop and maximise their potentials, so that they will eventually grow into independent, productive members of the society and are respected by the community.
Learning Disability is a tragic condition. Briefly, these children struggle to receive, retain and communicate information, learning today and forgetting it tomorrow. They find it very difficult to concentrate and reading is such a laborious effort. These setbacks are beyond their control. Often they have been labelled as stupid, dumb, lazy or retarded when in actual fact, these conditions usually hide a bright child whose intellect is waiting to be released given the right kind of alternate academic environment and therapeutic interventions.
The foundation upon which the CADS Enhancement Centre was developed is the belief that early intervention for children who are neurologically and developmentally disabled can enable them to achieve their full potential and enable them to attain a level of independence that will allow them to contribute appropriately to the society.
Our needs
The programme at CADS Enhancement Centre is open to LD Children of all faiths and religions, across all economic strata of family backgrounds.

Thank you for playing a part in fulfilling Yayasan Chow Kit’s mission. We run three centres in Chow Kit open to children and youth during the day. We operate in partnership with the Kementerian Pembagunan Wanita, Keluarga dan Masyarakat.
Yayasan Chow Kit is a new organisation that developed out of Nur Salam. The foundation was incorporated on 19 January 2011.

YCK’s daycare centre, ‘Taska Baitul Amal’ welcomes families to use the services provided for new- born babies until the age of four. The children will attend Pusat Jagaan Chow Kit from 5-7 years old. Once the children turn seven years old they will be welcomed into ‘Pusat Aktiviti Kanak-Kanak’ and upon reaching thirteen they move on to YCK’s youth activity centre – ‘KL Krash Pad’.
All the three centres provide food and age-appropriate facilities for our children. Yayasan Chow Kit opened the three centres based on a simple premise, to provide a safe and positive space in an area that may otherwise be unsafe, and allow for the children to grow up proud and not worry about the stigma attached to one of Kuala Lumpur’s vibrant and cosmopolitan inner city areas.",admin@yck.org.my ,Yayasan Chow Kit,http://www.yck.org.my,,

We are an independent charitable organisation dedicated to provide shelter, food, education and guidance to underprivileged children. These children come from broken homes, poverty-stricken families and some are abandoned.
We take them in and act as their legal guardians until they are ready to support themselves. We prioritise education as it is the only way the children would be able to stand on their own. But since they come form various backgrounds where education is often overlooked, we are facing a daunting task in getting them to be interested in school.

In promoting human dignity and integrity, the SSVP works to redress situations which adversely affect peoples’ lives and their basic rights. The SSVP was founded in 1833 by Frederic Ozanam who was then a student of Sorbonne University in Paris.
SSVP is established across the five continents in 133 countries, with a membership of 900,000. The SSVP aims to help men, women and families to break their cycle of poverty and disadvantage. It is not a benevolent society but works on a person to person basis.
The SSVP in Malaysia began in 1934 with the first Conference (as our branches are called) formed in the Church of the Assumption, Penang. To-date we have 62 conferences with a membership of 900.
The primary works of the Conferences in Malaysia is to give out monthly subsidies in the form of food rations, school expenses, bus fares and pay for schooling needs at the beginning of the school term like uniforms, shoes, exercise books and other yearly fee . Another important role is home visits to the needy to access their needs and also counsel them.
Sometimes in the mid 80’s the SSVP embarked on a mission of ‘teaching them to fish instead of providing them the fish’. The aim was to bring them out of the poverty cycle. It was then decided to set up Homes and bring children from poverty areas and broken families and provide them a conducive learning and living environment. This gave birth to the creation of the first Home ‘RUMAH OZANAM’(named after our founder Frederic Ozanam). Today SSVP in Selangor have 12 other homes/centers catering to various needs of the less fortunate among us.

This year, Projek Pelita aims to host the biggest book drive in Malaysia’s history. The books will then be used to restock rural areas school or public libraries in Sarawak. Projek Pelita strongly believes that education would be the means to break the poverty cycle and to uplift the quality of life and standard of living of Malaysians in rural areas.
 
As the Malay saying goes, ‘Ilmu Pelita Hidup’- education is vital for society development; be it inside or outside the classroom. However, sad but true, there seems to be a major shortage of books and educational resources for children and students in Malaysia. The major concern is that students who experience this shortage of reading materials are mostly living in rural areas, who are most likely cannot afford to buy books and other educational needs for themselves if not provided for.
To address this issue and as part of our efforts to create awareness and promote voluntarism within Malaysian youth, last year, the UKEC came up with ‘Projek Pelita’ with the aim to host the biggest book drive in Malaysia’s history.
 
1. To expose the public to the rural area side of Malaysia, providing the whole nation the opportunity to help the disadvantaged students from poor backgrounds.
2. To provide assistance in the form of book donations or purchase of teaching and education aids (e.g. reading materials, computers, etc.) to be distributed to the poor and underprivileged primary and secondary school students.
3. To build or refurbish educational facilities in rural areas of Malaysia, such as school libraries, community libraries, resource centres with the aim to provide a comfortable and conducive place to study.
4. Raising education awareness by carrying out motivational programmes to rural areas students with school academic performance will be closely monitored by Projek Pelita committee.

Dengan kelulusan pendaftaran ini, Jawatankuasa berkenaan telah bergerak cergas untuk mencapai matlamat penubuhannya. Atas jasa Y.Bhg Allahyarham Dato’ Haji Harun Idris dan isteri Y.Bhg Datin Salmah Suleiman, Kerajaan Negeri Selangor telah mengurniakan sebidang tanah di Mukim Hulu Kelang (HS.231) seluas 4.8 ekar mengikut dokumen kelulusan bilangan PHT.G.2/139/75. Untuk menentukan projek ini dapat dilaksanakan dengan jayanya Y.Bhg Allahyarham Dato’ Haji Harun Idris telah dilantik sebagai Pengerusi Pertubuhan ini.
Hasil dari usaha gigih mereka inilah, beberapa program telah dijalankan seperti Majlis Jamuan Makan Malam, Tayangan Perdana serta rayuan kepada ahli-ahli, Pertubuhan ini telah berjaya mendirikan bangunan Rumah bakti dengan kos sebanyak RM158,107.81. DYMM Almarhum Sultan Salahuddin Abdul Aziz Shah Alhaj ibni Almarhum Sultan Hisamuddin Alam Shah Sultan Selangor telah perkenan untuk menjadi Penaung RBHK. Pada peringkat awal, pengambilan anak-anak yatim telah mula dibuat pada tahun 1976 iaitu seramai 26 orang yang terdiri daripada 13 lelaki dan 13 perempuan yang berumur antara 6 hingga 12 tahun. RBHK telah dirasmikan oleh DYMM Sultan Selangor pada 5 Mac 1977. Dari setahun ke setahun jumlah anak-anak yatim telah bertambah dan sehingga kini pada tahun 2010, Rumah Bakti dihuni oleh seramai 81 orang yang berumur daripada 7 hingga 17 tahun.
Pada 2 Mac 1982 dua buah blok asrama dua tingkat yang baru telah siap dibina. Kedua blok asrama tersebut bernilai RM600,000.00 dan disumbangkan oleh Kerajaan Negeri Selangor dan hasil derma orang ramai. Sebuah surau juga telah dibina pada tahun 1984. Pada tahun 2009 sebuah surau baru telah dibina bagi menggantikan surau lama. Surau baru ini telah disumbangkan oleh Y. Bhg Datin Salmah Sulaiman, isteri Allahyarham Dato’ Haji Harun Idris. RBHK telah mendapat perpustakaan baru pada tahun 1989. Perpustakaan ini menjadi Pusat Sumber pada tahun 1997. Oleh kerana RBHK telah mendapat surau baru, maka surau lama yang dibina pada 1984 itu diubah suai menjadi Pusat Sumber yang baru.

IMPIAN, a Training Centre for children with Learning Disability and Autism was established in 1998 by two professionals, Y.Bhg. Datin Dr K Mangalaveni (Medical Practitioner) and Y.Bhg.Prof.Dr Zasmani Shafiee (Child and Adolescent Psychiatrist).
The purpose of setting up IMPIAN was the realisation to assist and provide opportunities for developing these special children’s potential in the real world. Among the programmes designed in IMPIAN are Early Intervention, Junior, Senior and Adult Programmes with Functional Academics and Vocational Programmes, Sheltered Workshop and Job Training. Other supplementary and support programmes include Occupational, Speech Therapy, Art, Music and Performing Arts and other Specialised Programmes.

Fees paid by parents of 60 special children at IMPIAN are estimated at RM40,000.00 per month which is not sufficient to cover the overall expenses as students fees vary according to their socio-economic status. To have a continuous and holistic program operational we do hope for support from private sectors and public in our fund raising and charitable activities.

The history of our work began in 1999. Through the outreach of New Covenant Community Church, Rev. Elisha Satvinder and his wife Petrina, the founders, quickly discovered many underprivileged families in the Sentul area.
Concerned over the welfare of the poor in the area, the church began to reach out to the community through basic home improvement services, grocery distribution, arrangement of free medical check-ups, raising support for school supplies, job placements and counselling. They quickly realised that with the limited resources and man-power at their disposal, this work, while helpful, would not have the lasting impact they so wanted to see.
Believing that quality education was the key to breaking the cycle of poverty, the efforts of the programme began to consolidate and focus solely on education. What began as simple tuition classes soon attracted a daily attendance of over 50 students. However, children who were already behind continued to struggle.
After some training, efforts where renewed with a focus on toddlers and preschool aged children.
The work officially came under the name of Harvest Centre in 2003 and the first Montessori Preschool for the underprivileged opened its doors to 30 students in January, 2004. As the education programmes began to grow, the primary and secondary education programmes were added on.
In 2010, all Harvest Centre education projects came under the name of Dignity for Children Foundation.
Dignity aims to is to empower underprivileged children to break the cycle of poverty through quality education, thus positively transforming their lives and the lives of the community around them.

I approached the local developer, Dato Tan Seng Leong, to give me the free use of a shop lot to start this community centre in early 2009. For the first two years, I used up all my monies from my EPF to finance this project. In 2011 and 2012, it was funded by the Nanyang Press Foundation.
I provide three free services – English tuition for UPSR pupils, counselling, and a library. I had single-handedly taught the classes for the first two years, with one class in 2009, and then two classes in 2010.
In 2011, with the financial support from the Nanyang Press Foundation, I was able to have seven classes (7 x 40) with a total of about 280 pupils. However, in 2012, I reduced the class size to about 30, so I had only about 210 pupils. About 80% of the pupils are from the urban poor
In addition, I personally teach two VIP (Very Important Pupils) classes. They are referred to as at-risk student. They are poor secondary school students who are mainly from single-parent families and/or who are having disciplinary problems in schools.
(I am currently enrolled in the Master in Counselling program at the Open University Malaysia).
This year, I was given the free use of an extra adjoining lot to be used as a library-cum-counselling centre. It will also be used as a place for youth to hangout and to “chillax” (to chill out and relax).
1.I need a volunteer to help me to key in the data of the books and magazines.
2.I need a volunteer to teach the VIP classes if I happen to be out of town (attending seminars or workshops).
I also need a van – for use as a mobile library and to ferry students who don’t even have transport to come for the free tuition.

The objective of the school is to provide education/training for children with intellectual disabilities. Sekolah Semangat Maju Sitiawan provides education for about 70 mentally disabled children and the school is run on a non-profit basis managed by volunteers. Parents of the children are also trained to take care of the children’s special needs. The New Zealand government supports the school by generously donating a van for transporting the children.
Our courses
Three types of courses are provided, i.e. early development programme for children between three and six years, the educational classes for children between the ages of six and 18 years, and skilled training course for students between 18 and 22 years of age.

The classrooms are located on the 1st floor of a former maternity home and the school shares the compound with a nursing home for the elderly. The monthly school running costs including the salaries of seven of our staff including four teachers sometimes exceed RM10,000 and are totally funded from donations from local well wishers.

Borneo Child Aid Society is a Malaysian registered NGO providing education for underprivileged children. It provides education and healthcare primarily to children of plantation workers in Malaysia’s North Borneo state of Sabah. These children are largely without access to basic education because of distance, poverty or legal status.
At the time of writing, they operate a total of 87 small schools or Pusat Bimbingan in different plantations in Sabah, spread out from Tangkulap, located about 50 km from Telupid in the Sandakan Area, to Sebatik 2, located about 10 km from Tawau. The schools accept children, locals and foreigners, according to the UN’s Charter for Children. Each school has an average of 50 pupils.
As they operate mainly in plantations, where the workers are mostly Indonesians and Filipinos, the children at the schools are mostly foreigners. However, due to lack of government schools in some of those areas and poor accessibility, the Society also provides education to locals, which are mostly children of office or plantation staff. The children learn the Malaysian curriculum.
The majority of the teachers at the schools are Filipinos or Indonesians, but the number of local teachers is growing. The Society encourages a good mix of local and foreign teachers. Teachers go through a 2-year training period.
For our current projects, click here.
Our needs
Volunteers are welcome. Please contact organisation for more information about how you can help.
With a fast growing project, there are many things, which they need in order to develop their program and to benefit the education of the kids here. Run on a shoestring (US$ 8 per month per child) the project cannot afford to pay for most of this. They require additional funding to be able to develop this unique program.
They have also made a wish list here, in the hope that you or your company can contribute with some of the much needed items. The Society also welcomes donations in kind such as books and medicine.
About 80% of the operating expenses for the 87 schools is covered by donations from plantation companies and other donors. To ensure continuity, Borneo Child Aid Society is looking for permanent sponsors/donors to make up the remaining 20%.

Asrama Bakti ditubuhkan pada tahun 1987 dan mula diduduki sepenuhnya dalam tahun 1988. Ia dirasmikan oleh DYMM Raja Perempuan Kelantan pada tahun 1992. Matlamat utama tertubuhnya asrama ini adalah untuk membela nasib anak-anak yatim dan miskin di dalam jajahan Machang untuk meneruskan pelajaran dengan lebih baik dan selesa. 
PENTADBIRAN
Asrama Bakti diletakkan dibawah jawatankuasa pengurusan asrama yang dibentuk secara sukarela dan dipengerusikan sendiri oleh YABRS Ketua Jajahan Machang. Penyeliaan, penjagaan dan pengurusan makan minum dilaksanakan oleh seorang penyelia bersama isterinya secara sukarela. Sumber kewangan asrama hanya mengharapkan derma dan sumbangan dari orang perseorangan dan badan-badan swasta.
 
PENGHUNI
Penghuni Asrama Bakti meningkat dari tahun ke tahun. Tahun 2015 mencatat lebih kurang seramai 35 orang penghuni. Rata-rata mereka adalah dari Jajahan Pasir Mas, Kuala Krai dan Machang. Mereka berumur dalam lingkungan 7 hingga 17 tahun dan bersekolah di sekitar Machang dan ditanggung sepenuhnya oleh pihak asrama.
KEJAYAAN PENGHUNI
Meskipun pelajar-pelajar terdiri daripada golongan yatim lagi miskin, tetapi kegigihan dan usaha mereka dalam menimba ilmu pelajaran adalah membanggakan. Asrama Bakti juga mampu mengeluarkan pelajar-pelajar yang berjaya melanjutkan pelajaran ke pusat-pusat pengajian tinggi seperti Universiti Malaysia Sabah – jurusan kewangan antarabangsa, Universiti al-Azhar Cairo – bidang dakwah, Universiti Teknologi MARA (UiTM) – kajian penyaki, kejuruteraan, perubatan dan sebagainya.
 
ANGGARAN PERBELANJAAN
Setiap tahun jawatankuasa terpaksa berusaha untuk mendapatkan bantuan sebanyak sekurang-kurangnya RM 110,000.00 setahun daripada orang ramai , kerajaan, badan swasta dan sebagainya untuk menghidupkan dan meneruskan kesinambungan asrama anak yatim ini.
Perbelanjaan makan minum 7.00 x 30 x 30 = RM 6,300.00

About Pusat Kebajikan Kalvari (PKK)
Pusat Kebajikan Kalvari Johor’s first home started in December 1989 at ‘Jalan Dapat’ in Johor Bahru. Today 23 Homes and Centres have been set up within the Johor Bahru area.

Johor’s (PKK) Homes and Centres amount to RM2.53 million annually. The founding church (Calvary City Church) provides approximately 30% of the finances. The balance 70% come from general public- both individuals and corporations- who have been generous and faithful in their donations.
Our services
Presently we are sheltering, feeding, nurturing, educating or rehabilitating a total of over 580 people (residents, day special education centre children and care givers).

History

The Boys’ Brigade was founded in Glasgow, Scotland on 4 October 1883 by Sir William Alexander Smith. It became the oldest uniform youth organisation in the world. It spread rapidly to North America, Europe, Africa, Australia and New Zealand. However, the BB did not appear in the Asian scene until 1915 when the first Company was founded in the Chinese city of Swatow by the Rev Guthrie Gamble (the famous Swatow BB was to become a legend in later years in China) The BB came to South East Asia in 1930 with the founding of the 1st Singapore Company by Mr James Fraser.
The Boys’ Brigade did not come to Malaya until the after the second World War. A British soldier by the name ofimages/rd.jpg (10412 bytes) Robert Davis (former Captain of 6th Birkenhead Company at the Tranmere Freehold Methodist Church and later Tranmere United Reformed Church) gave the idea of The Boys’ Brigade to one of Penang’s great educationist, the late Mr Geh Hun Kheng, who accepted the challenge becoming the first BB Captain in Malaya. Mr Geh realised that he had to do his “small share” to win the Boys over from the various subversive groups that were so rife after the Pacific War. The first meeting of 20 Boys was held in the Methodist Church in Madras Lane on a Sunday in September 1946. Penang thus became the images/merdeka.jpg (16678 bytes)springboard from which Companies were started first in Kuala Lumpur and then in other parts of the country. When Malaysia achieved independence on 31 August 1957, The Boys’ Brigade was given the honour of being invited to take part in the Merdeka Parade (Independence Day Parade).
After Merdeka (Independence), The Boys’ Brigade began to spread rapidly as a result of the formation of the Malayan Council of The Boys’ Brigade under the initiative of Mr Khoo Oon Soo. More and more Companies were founded in every major town in Malaya. Even small rural towns began to have BB Companies functioning efficiently. By this time firm and friendly contact had been made with the BB in Singapore which helped in the supply and sale of equipment and with the founding of the first Company in Borneo in 1959, the 1st Kuching Company. In 1962, the BB in Malaya became a member of the Pacific Regional Fellowship (subsequently joined the East Asia Regional Fellowship when it was formed later) and the first Pacific camp was held with the co-operation of the Singapore Battalion in Port Dickson in December 1963.
On 5 December 1964, the former Federation of Malaya Council of The Boys’ Brigade, the Singapore Battalion and the 1st Kuching Company merged into The Boys’ Brigade in Malaysia. With the political separation of Singapore from Malaysia, The Boys’ Brigade in Singapore ceased to be a component District of The Boys’ Brigade in Malaysia as on 19 August 1965. With Malaysia a reality the National Council began to establish Companies in Sabah and Sarawak, maintaining friendly ties with the BB in Singapore.
The development of The Boys’ Brigade in Malaysia took a revolutionary turn when it invited girls to be members. It was first introduced in 1989 and debated for a few years before experimental measures were approved in 1992. The move received favourable response and strong support from churches and individuals. Today, more than 20 companies in the BBM have girls on their membership roll, and many girls have been appointed NCOs, and they have proven to be capable in adapting well to the activities of the BB.
Since 1992, The Boys’ Brigade in Malaysia has also begun to play significant role in the extension of BB work in the East Asia Regional Fellowship, including conducting training and support BB works in Indonesia, Thailand and the Philippines.
Today, there are over 70 Companies spread throughout the length and breadth of Malaysia. Ever since the setting up of a BBHQ in 1989, a permanent building has been purchased, and currently staffed by a team of five able full-time personnel.
The Boys’ Brigade in Malaysia has come a long way since 1946. Many things have since changed, many had come and gone with many new developments taken place. Throughout all these years, the BBM has been able to hold on to its object and continue in serving the youth of Malaysia. As the nation is fast moving towards greater heights in development, it is believed that the BB shall be called on to play an even greater role in the development and training of the Malaysian youths.",info@bbmalaysia.org, hq@bbmalayasia.org,Boy’s Brigade in Malaysia (BBM),http://www.bbmalaysia.org,

Today, the centre accommodates almost 155 children with age-range that varies from 3 years to 51 years old. Despite having “adults” as our inmates, the centre still term them as “children”.
The word “children” here is used loosely and it reflects the condition and the similar situation with which the young ones are facing. Most of the children are mentally disabled, meaning, they are unable to take care of themselves. Apart from mental deficiency, there are also cases such as Down Syndrome, Spastic, Cerebral Palsy, Hyperactive and Autism. They also have abuse cases and normal cases where the mothers are psychiatric patients and therefore unable to care for the children.

WAY works for promotion of youth and youth organisations in programme areas such as: youth employment, environment, human rights, democracy, population, health, drugs, community development and leadership training.
History
In 1949, an initiative was undertaken to establish a youth organisation to promote global cooperation and understanding amongst the young people of the world. Recognizing the need for a universal youth organisation, youth leaders from national youth councils of all member countries of the United Nations were invited to attend an international conference in London . In August 1949, the international conference held at Westminster Hall in London established the World Assembly of Youth.
The draft charter, which had been prepared in February 1949 in Ashbridge , England , was ratified at the first official meeting of WAY in Brussels a year later. The meeting, organised by the Belgian Youth Council, was attended by more than 100 young people from 37 countries. The WAY Charter was ratified by 29 of the national youth councils present, and WAY began its work on behalf of the world youth community.
The WAY headquarters has moved throughout the years to various bases including Brussels , Paris , London and Copenhagen . In 1999, the WAY headquarters moved to Kuala Lumpur , Malaysia and now has finally established its headquarters building, the World Youth Complex, in Melaka, a southern state of Malaysia.
Background
The World Assembly of Youth recognises the Universal Declaration of Human Rights as the basis of its action and services. WAY promotes the work of youth organisations in areas such as: democracy, environment, human rights, population, health, drugs, community development, leadership training, and cultural and religious tolerance. It provides opportunities for youth representatives from different countries to exchange ideas and experiences, to coordinate program plans, and to reach a better understanding of each others’ problems due to differences in racial, religious and national backgrounds.

Angkatan Belia Islam Malaysia (ABIM) telah ditubuhkan pada 6 Ogos 1971 di Fakulti Pengajian Islam, Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia. Pengerusi penaja penubuhannya ialah Ustaz Abdul Wahab Abdullah (Almarhum) dan Setiausahanya ialah Sdr. Fauzi Abdul Rahman (Dato’). Pada 17 Ogos 1972, ABIM telah didaftarkan secara rasmi di-bawah Akta Pertubuhan 1966.
Manakala pada tahun 2009, setelah pihak kerajaan membuat semakan terhadap dasar belia negara, ABIM telah didaftarkan penubuhannya di-bawah Akta Pertubuhan-pertubuhan Belia 2007. ABIM telah melangsungkan Persidangan Agung Tahunan atau Muktamar yang pertama pada tahun 1972 di mana Prof Dr. Razali Nawawi telah dipilih sebagai Presiden pertama.
Era awal pergerakannya dicorakkan oleh usaha bagi memperteguhkan idealisme dan cita-cita perjuangan. Pelbagai kegiatan direncanakan bagi menjelaskan identiti ABIM sebagai sebuah pertubuhan belia dan gerakan Islam yang berteraskan prinsip dakwah dan tarbiah sebagai teras utama gerakannya.
Pada tahun 1974, ABIM telah memilih Sdr Anwar Ibrahim sebagai Presiden kedua. Sepanjang era kepimpinan beliau, ABIM muncul sebagai sebuah gerakan Islam yang berpengaruh di peringkat nasional dan antarabangsa, kerana pendirian tegasnya terhadap pelbagai persoalan ekonomi, kebudayaan dan politik.
Kepimpinan ABIM di Era Dato’ Dr Siddiq Fadzil mulai tahun 1983 telah menumpukan usaha dakwah bil hal (dakwah di dalam bentuk praktikal) untuk menyelesaikan permasalahan masyarakat dan umat secara lebih berkesan dan proaktif.
Pada tahun 1991, Dr Muhammad Nur Manuty telah mengambil alih kepimpinan ABIM sebagai Presiden keempat. Di era ini, ABIM terlibat secara aktif dalam proses pembinaan negara selaku partner in nation building. ABIM juga mula mengembangkan peranannya di peringkat antarabangsa terutama sekali memperjuang nasib umat Islam di Afghanistan dan Bosnia Herzegovina.
Kepimpinan ABIM beralih kepada Hj Ahmad Azam Abdul Rahman pada tahun 1997. Di era ini, ABIM telah memperkukuhkan peranannya di arena antarabangsa menerusi penubuhan Misi Keamanan Sejagat (MKS). Di sebalik kemelut politik tanahair yang melanda pada ketika itu, ABIM telah menyumbang dengan konstruktif menggagaskan agenda Penyatuan Ummah seluruh masyarakat Melayu Islam di Malaysia.
Pada tahun 2005, Dr Yusri Mohamad telah mengambil alih kepimpinan ABIM sebagai Presiden ke enam. Di era kepimpinan beliau, ABIM telah menyumbang dengan aktif di dalam aspek kenegaraan terutama berkaitan isu kedudukan istimewa Islam di dalam perlembagaan dan persoalan syariah di dalam masyarakat majmuk.
Peralihan terbaru kepimpinan ABIM telah berlaku pada Ogos 2009 di mana Dr Muhamad Razak Idris telah dipilih sebagai Presiden ketujuh, yang menumpukan kepada menyegarkan semula idealism serta orientasi ABIM selaku gerakan Ilmu dan Bakti, yang kini dilanjutkan oleh Saudara Amidi Abd Manan selaku presiden ABIM kelapan mulai Julai 2011.",sap@abim.org.my,Angkatan Belia Islam Malaysia (ABIM),http://www.abim.org.my ,,
1104,8A Jalan Masjid Negeri 11600 Penang,Youth,+604-8280-741,,"Who are we
YWCA is one of the oldest women’s organisation in Penang founded in 1909 and has faithfully played its role in addressing the various social needs of the community (Serving women, youth and children to achieve development and equity in the society) regardless of race or religion.
YWCA Penang celebrated her 100th Anniversary in 2009, and was the first YWCA to be established in Malaysia after the YWCA of Singapore (1875). Mrs A V Aston, President of YWCA Penang in 1951 wrote, “At present we rent a room at No. 27 Anson Road, but we now want to expand and have a club room of our own; we want to establish a girls’ hostel. YWCA hostels are famous throughout the world, and Penang needs one now. Will you help us to get one?”
In 1958, after years of hard work and cooperation met with magnanimous contributions, the dream became a reality.
Who we are today
Now, at the age of 61 years, after faithfully serving through the years, the hostel needs new water piping, to be followed by repairs to its roof, ceiling, fencing and other parts of the building. This will be made possible through the contribution of kind benefactors such as yourself and for this, we are truly grateful.
The current building at 8A Jalan Masjid Negeri has outlived its service in continuing to provide the necessary facilities required of the members to carry out the work effectively.
Our services
The hostel continued to expand, to become a home-away-from home for a larger number of women and girls. We also run an affordable kindergarten, Day Care Centre, Women’s hostels, Computer classes for the community at very reasonable charges.

1160,"No. 236, Jalan Taman Kerjasama Taman Kerjasama 34000 Taiping Perak",Children/Support Groups/Youth,+605 806 0667,Dolly Tan,"BACKGROUND
CHILD stands for Caring & Helping Individuals with Learning Disabilities.
The CHILD Early Intervention Programme (EIP) centre was birthed as a result of the coming together of a group of like-minded parents who saw a great need to provide practical help to an ever increasing number of children with learning disabilities and their families in and around Taiping. Hence, a committee was set up to look into ways to help this target group. The CHILD Society was registered and its first project was to start an EIP centre. The CHILD-EIP Centre came into operation in June 2010, providing a UK-based “early intervention program” (or EIP) for children aged 6 months to 6 years old. Gradually, the program will expand to cater to those above 6 years old and ‘home-based’ children who cannot attend lessons at the centre due to various circumstances.
All services provided are offered to clients based on needs; no distinction is made based on sex, race, religion or financial background.
CHILD Society is purely a ‘not-for-profit’ service-provider NGO to children with special needs and their families which is wholly dependent on public sponsorships and donations to fund its programs. To prevent sudden stoppage of services due to a lack of incoming funds in unforeseen circumstances, CHILD Society practices prudent financial management with a healthy spread between spending and saving.
The core service of CHILD-EIP Centre is to provide the Early Intervention Program to children with learning disabilities, mostly with autistic or Downe –syndrome backgrounds. The EIP seeks to instill a broad range of skills over time : academic learning, self-help & living skills, behaviour modification, counselling for affected families, etc. Obviously, learning cannot be conducted in normal big classroom style but in small groups and one-on-one sessions. The teachers become then the backbone and are central to the success of the EIP and CHILD Society’s mission.
Mission Statement of CHILD Society:
“To empower, support and encourage children with special needs and their families through training, caring and community participation”. 
Why an IEP Centre in Taiping?
The rationale to start the centre in Taiping arose out of a great need to give hope and services to the learning disabled children and their families in Taiping and the surrounding areas. Through the Taiping Hospital’s Therapy department and some NGOs in Taiping, we estimated that the number of learning disabled children below the age of 7 years who will benefit tremendously from the EIP but who do not have access to such learning services run into several hundreds. Some of the more affluent families send their children to Ipoh or Penang once or twice a week to access these services. For those who do not have the means to travel weekly, such children are left without any opportunity to learn and better themselves. The need is great. Conservatively, there may be more than 300 young special children in Taiping and the hinterland who need the Early Intervention Program.
NEEDS
Cash contribution towards our centre for specific expenses such as staff salaries & training, learning facilities for children and purchase of teaching aids & equipment.
The funds requested are to sustain the on-going programs which provide various much-needed services to children with special needs and their families; to continue upgrading relevant skill areas of the staff through training; purchase of new teaching aids/equipment to replace defective/worn-out ones and to build up the resource centre.
CHILD Society is unable to generate income through children-involved activities or product sales since it is purely a service provider for very young children with special needs. Neither can much income be expected through collection of fees from these families as most of them are financially strained by additional expenses for the special-needs child such as speech / occupational / physio therapy, special equipment for physical impairment and medical costs.
Present and Future Needs
The CHILD-EIP Centre currently operates from a single-storey link house (20 ft x 60 ft) and has 1 Teacher catering to 15 special needs students. As at April 2012, we already have 30 children on the waiting list but cannot admit them due to space and staff constraints. We have plans to shift to a bigger premise and employ 2 more teaching staff by December 2012.
Unavoidably, teachers’ training and Teaching-aids consume a higher allocation during the initial phases of establishing an EIP centre. The main activities are based on using numerous forms of teaching aids to not only introduce concepts, facts, etc., but also to reinforce learning in an interesting and dynamic way. As the child progresses in abilities, so do the teaching tools. Hence, the variety of teaching tools has to be wide. And sadly, many of these items are imported and expensive. As the pool of teaching resources build up over time, the need to purchase them decreases. The same goes for staff training: the initial phase of acquiring needed teaching skills is more intensive and frequent. It tapers as the staff become more skilled and experienced.",child.society@yahoo.com,CHILD Early Intervention Programme Centre,,,

The centre was founded by Mr V. Rajamanikam, then with only seven children, the centre solely depended on public donations. Today, the centre accommodates almost 155 children with age-range that varies from three years to 51 years old. Despite having “adults” as our inmates, the centre still term them as “children”. The word “children” here is used loosely and it reflects the condition and the similar situation with which the young ones are facing. Most of the children are mentally disabled, meaning, they are unable to take care of themselves. Apart from mental deficiency, there are also cases such as Down Syndrome, Spastic, Cerebral Palsy, Hyperactive and Autism. They also have abuse cases and normal cases where the mothers are psychiatric patients and therefore unable to care for the children.
The building is located at Saleng in the district of Senai, about 30 minutes drive from JB. Situated at the heart of a multiracial residential area, the place is blessed with a tranquil ambience and a friendly neighbourhood.
For his outstanding work, Mr V. Rajamanikam has received several awards, some of them are “The Guinness Stout Effort Award in 1992 “, “Heart of Gold Award” organised by the News Straits Times in 1996. He has also visited Mother Theresa in 1992. In 1997, Mr Rajamanikam received the P.IS. award from the Sultan of Johor for his humanitarian efforts.

In 1993, the housing development corporation of Taman Desa Rahmat started out an Al-Quran class at the housing area’s mosque; Masjid Al Khairiah as part of their contribution to the community. This class expands to a Tahfiz Al-Quran school for children with the help of Ustaz Hilmy al-hafiz in 1994. The students who are admitted comprises of orphans [boys] from all over Kelantan.
In 1996, the Tahfiz Al-Quran centre officially becomes PEKAYATIM, which is a part of PEYATIM – Pertubuhan Kebajikan Anak Yatim Malaysia [Malaysian Orphans’ Welfare Organisation] (Reg. No: 1193/96 Kel). PEKAYATIM is now a full-fledged orphanage for boys, which provides education in the form of Tahfiz al-Quran, care for the orphans, and help prepare them for the future by helping them secure places in Islamic courses within local higher institutions.
However, currently the Tahfiz centre can only accommodate up to 30 orphans, due to lack of resources and financial means as it relies on public funding. Thus they are also currently unable to accept girls. Stringent interviews are conducted to ensure the orphans accepted are serious about studying Tahfiz al-Quran and make it their chosen stream in Universities.
PEKAYATIM only admits orphan boys aged 10 to 22, and they will spend the next couple of years studying the al-Quran and prepare for the exams that will enable them to further their education. There have been 12 graduates of the school thus far.

It also provides as temporary accommodation to those employed blind persons but are unable to obtain their own accommodation elsewhere.

Our story began in 1992. Initiated by the Social Concerns Committee of the Canning Garden Methodist Church (CGMC), we started out in a rented shop house in Ipoh’s famous “Old Town” as Daybreak Centre. A first of its kind, we set out to help the disabled find a meaningful place in society by providing a training ground in specialized skills and a retail center for their handicrafts. Within two years, our trainees grew in numbers. There were also many who were successfully placed in permanent jobs that we decided to move our Training department to a larger premise in Gopeng so we could reach out to those living around that area and help them benefit from our program too. However, our Administration and Handicrafts departments remained in Ipoh.
OUR VISION
We are always on the lookout for passionate and enthusiastic men and women of all ages to connect with our vision of:
empowering people with disabilities regardless of race or creed,
to help them become self-reliant, independent and integrated members of society.
Our Corporate Mission
Our Core Values
In order to accomplish our core values, we here at Daybreak strives to create an environment that embodies certain core values with strong humanitarian undertones:
It is clear that we are very mindful of taking a focused approach in our humble attempts to make positive transformations to the lives of the disabled. Simply because we are convinced that, every disabled person deserves to be treated with respect and dignity, and is entitled to a fair, safe and humane living environment.",info@daybreak.org.my ,"Persatuan Daybreak Untuk  Kebajikan Orang-Orang Cacat  Kinta, Perak",http://www.daybreak.org.my/,,

Persatuan ini merupakan satu-satunya pertubuhan bukan kerajaan yang mewakili kepentingan dan kebajikan orang pekak seluruh negeri Pulau Pinang.
Sejarah persatuan ini dapat disusul sejak 1980an semasa SHIMA (Society of Hearing Impaired Malaysia) cuba ditubuhkan oleh Mohamad Sazali di Kuala Lumpur untuk menyatupadukan orang-orang pekak Malaysia. Sebagai langkah pertama, beliau menubuhkan SHIMA Wilayah Persekutuan dan Selangor. Seiring dengan langkah beliau, pemimpin-pemimpin pekak di Pulau Pinang iaitu Teh Kean Hoe, Wan Mohd. Ali Bin Wan Abu Bakar, Razman Tan, Yusof Hassan, Tan Cheng Yong dan Saleem Ali telah berusaha menubuhkan SHIMA Pulau Pinang pada tahun 1992 dan didaftar secara rasmi. Untuk selama beberapa tahun, SHIMA Pulau Pinang tidak mempunyai pejabat yang tetap. Para AJK mengadakan perjumpaan di rumah AJK, kantin Sekolah Pendidikan Khas Jalan Hutton dan beberapa tempat yang lain. Pada tahun 1996, SHIMA Pulau Pinang telah ditukar nama kepada Persatuan Orang Pekak Pulau Pinang (PDA) dan beroperasi di pejabat tetap di Kompleks Masyarakat Penyayang.
Selepas Persekutuan Orang Pekak Malaysia (MFD) ditubuhkan, Persatuan Orang Pekak Pulau Pinang menjadi anggota gabungan MFD. Beberapa tahun kebelakangan ini, PDA memperlihatkan kemajuan pesat dalam pemberian perkhidmatan untuk komuniti pekak. Melalui kerjasama dengan MFD, PUSKOM Pulau Pinang ditubuhkan. Pemulihan Dalam Komuniti (PDK) Orang Pekak Pulau Pinang juga ditubuhkan dengan sokongan Jabatan Kebajikan Masyarakat.

Its primary objective is to provide basic education, living skills and welfare aids to the mentally handicapped children in Seberang Perai Utara, Butterworth.

Way back in 1976, it was initiated by a group of concerned parents, social workers and some voluntary clubs in and around Butterworth to form a centre to cater for this group of handicapped children. In the early stage, there were about 12 children and was managed by 2 teachers on a voluntary basis.

First patron of this centre was our beloved “Bapa Kemerdekaan” Yang Teramat Mulia Tunku Abdul Rahman Putra Al-Haj.

At present PEKTAS is managed by a Committee comprising of members, and is under the direct jurisdiction of District Welfare Department of Butterworth with PENGERUSI JAWATANKUASA KESIHATAN, KEBAJIKAN & MASYARAKAT PENYAYANG KERAJAAN NEGERI PULAU PINANG as our Patron.

We now have a new school building of our own for these unfortunate children in Mak Mandin Butterworth. There are 7 classrooms and 50 registered Mentally Retarded Children receiving basic education and training from 7 dedicated teachers. This centre is managed by a supervisor and assisted by a clerk.

We moved into this new building on 24th November 1997, and was declared opened on 17.04.1998 by Y.B.Datuk Paduka Hajjah Zaleha Binti Ismail Minister of Welfare and Social Development Malaysia. The centre is in full operation now.

Children’s that Suffering from the effects of poverty or lacking normal parental care and supervision is a crucial part of social welfare and also becomes an important index for showing whether a society is progressive or not. Therefore, to safeguard the legal rights and life quality for the disabled, it guarantee a fair opportunity of their participation, and provide sufficient service for them.
These disadvantaged individuals due to their mental condition cannot compete or survive like the rest of us. They need a fighting chance to make it, in today’s competitive world. They depend on the rest of us to survive in this world.
Vinashini Home was established on 1st August 2002. The home was mainly set up to ensure the needs of mentally and physically challenged children and adults in our society were successfully met. Children and adults of varying degree disability are provided with sufficient basic needs such as lodging, clothing and special care services in our home. These disadvantaged individuals due to their incapability are unable to lead a normal life unlike the very privileged rest of us. To be able to sustain, survive and to make it in life, a helping hand makes a huge difference.
The home was first set up at 757, Taman Yoon Chan, Jalan Tok Ungku, 70100 Seremban for about 2 years. It was a rented premise. Soon after being given the option to either purchase the said property or shift to another premise,on 5th September 2004, we shifted to 366, Jalan Nilam 15, Taman Jayamas, Jalan Tun Dr. Ismail 70200 Seremban, Negeri Sembilan. We rented 2 premises here. We have been in the above, mentioned place for almost 7 years. To date, we have 67 inmates living in Vinashini Home. There are 36 males and 31 females all together. They are affected by different type of disorders (mental retardation, physical disability, speech impairment, down syndrome, hyperactive disorder, etc). We also have 18 school going children where 11 of them are in normal government primary and secondary school  7 in special school, and another 3 inmates persuing tertiary education in colleges. Transportation for these kids are also provided daily. Besides that all the schooling children are also sent for tuition classes.
With the growing number of inhabitants, the need for a new home with adequate space and accommodations was inevitable. Hence, now we are based at  a new place close to Mambau. The address of the place is A-10 Batu 41/2, Jalan Kuala Sawah Mambau, 70300 Seremban. With the new home which spreads across an acre of land,we could easily accommodate  the ever growing number of occupants with sufficient space and provide them with enough amenities .A total cost of RM 550,000 was needed to put up the building which now stands tall holding all of its happy, contended inhabitants.   The cash needed for the funding of the whole project was collected through the ‘Vinashini Home Charity Dinner Fund’, which was held for 4 years consecutively, and also through donation from charitable, generous public.
The Home is also registered legally under Welfare Department and is excluded of tax exemption under Section 44(6) of Akta Cukai Pendapatan 1967. The government recognized the home as an authorized charitable institution under “No. Warta Kerajaan: 18667 effective from 23rd October 2008 for tax exemption purposes. Currently the home is financed by donations from the community and also from the JKM Grant.",info@vinashinihome.com,Persatuan Kebajikan Vinashini,http://www.vinashinihome.com,,

CVC is a non-profit facility in Johor Bahru which specifically offers Special Education Programmes for Children with Autism from 3 to 18 years of age. CVC accepts children from all socio econimic, ethnic or religious backgrounds. The only constraint in accepting students is the limitations of our resources in terms of school space, staffing and funds.
Our ‘Mission Statement’ is to equip autistic children to lead meaningful and independent lives within Malaysian society.
The Programmes currently offered are:-
1.Early Intervention Programme (age 3-6 years old)
2. Primary School Special Programme ( age 7-11 years old )
3. Pre-vocational Programme (age 12-18 years old )

Independent Living and Training Centre, Selangor and Wilayah Persekutuan Kuala Lumpur is a non-profit, charitable organisation established on 6th September 2001 and is registered with the Malaysia Registrar of Societies (ROS).
Our aim
The main aim of the ILTC is to train and provide residents with all the necessary assistance to develop abilities and to maximize their level of independence so that they are able to achieve as full and as possible no matter what their physical disabilities.
History
In 1999, a few of us with disabilities decided that the way forward is to take more control of our lives and to work towards equal opportunities, self-respect and self-determination. The result of that meeting together was the birth of the Independent Living & Training Centre to promote Independent Living movement within Malaysia. This is a centre for people with disabilities run by people with disabilities themselves.

Our needs
We rely on those individuals in different ways contribute. You can support our work in many ways.
Over the years, donations from friends and the public have helped to maintain the programmes at Independent Living and Training Centre. The welfare department also gives a small annual grant. More money is needed to improve and expend the service to meet the need of the increasing number of disabled persons requiring help.

PPIA is a duly registered non-profit, charitable organisation, committed to serving children and youths with intellectual challenges in and around the town of Batu Pahat, irrespective of race and religion.
PPIA is registered under the Registrar of Societies, with the registration number of ROS No. 1624. PPIA is recognised as a tax-exempted organisation and is mainly dependent on public funding.
PPIA hopes to change the lives of children and youths with intellectual challenges through education and training, which will help them to progress in life.
Our History
PPIA was started in 1999, in response to a dire need to help the many children with intellectual challenges in the town of Batu Pahat. Their medical conditions range from Down Syndrome, Autism, Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), Cerebral Palsy, Epilepsy, Dyslexia and other forms of disabilities.
Their needs were not met at that time, as there was a lack of public awareness, facilities and special help in Batu Pahat. Ignorance, social stigma, superstitions and general apathy towards them and their families further confined and isolated them from society.
It was due to this crying need for help that Gereja Grace Batu Pahat initiated this community project, which has continued and expanded until today. Since 1999, PPIA has continued to grow from one programme to the four programmes that it has right now. PPIA’s expansion has allowed us to greatly increase our scope of work and the number of clients that we service.

The Handicapped Children’s Centre (HCC) is a charitable organisation which was established in 1964 by a group of Australian housewives. Originally called the Handicapped Orphans Appeal, the centre’s main objective was to raise funds to help orphans with heart and physical defects. A year later, Malaysian women became involved and took over the responsibilities of extending the centre’s services to other special children as needs arose.
In 1967, a training centre was set up for children with multiple disabilities who are often found not suitable for placement in any of the established institutions. The HCC was first housed at the State Youth Centre and later moved to a community hall at Pulau Tikus, and then to the Wesley Methodist Church Hall.
In 1978, the Penang State Government leased the present property at Grove Road for a nominal fee. The centre was officially opened in March 1982 by the then TYT Yang Di Pertua Negeri, Tun Dr Hj Awang bin Hassan.

A Brief History of The Johor Cheshire
The establishment of the Cheshire Home in Johor was initiated by His Highness the late Sultan Ibrahim and Her Highness the late Sultanah Marcella who having followed the progress made by the Cheshire Home (Malaya) Singapore branch readily gave their consent when approached by the Singapore branch to set up a similar home in Johor Bahru.
The Johor Social Welfare Department was given the task to organise the Home with support from other government departments and the Singapore Branch Committee.
On 1st February 1959, a Management Committee was formed with Lt Col E. A. Horsey, OBE being elected as its first Chairman and Che’ Khalsom as the Chairman of the Appeals Committee.
In December, a site was identified and work started in earnest as RMAF and RAF (Malaya) personnel began the tedious task of clearing the area of rubber trees and undergrowth during their weekends.
Meanwhile, the Appeals Committee was busy raising funds and their efforts were so successful that cash and materials were generously donated by the public. With these resources in hand, work on the Home took on an urgent pace. The hard work finally paid off and the Johore Cheshire Home was officially declared open by His Highness the late Sultan Ismail who also became the Home first Patron. The Johore Cheshire Home is unique for it is the first of its kind in Johore and Malaysia to be built and maintained by volunteers. This uniqueness prompted Cheshire to mention in one of his letters that “The Johore Home will be the only one entirely built by voluntary labour and therefore stands out as a Landmark in the Foundation”.
The Home is administered by a Management Committee comprising of volunteers and is completely autonomous. The primary objective of the Home is for the chronically ill who are unable to look after themselves but have no relatives or home to turn to and who otherwise would be occupying useful bed space in government hospitals. Although residents who are able to contribute towards the maintenance of the Home will be ask to do so, no one is turned away of inability to pay.
In 1970, the Johore Cheshire Home was constitutionally separated from the Singapore Home and began to operate on its own.
Since its inception in 1960, the Home underwent two major renovations. One was in 1980 as part of its 21st Anniversary celebration while in 1984 a new block to house residents was put up at cost of RM 500,000.00 with funds donated by the Federal Government.
Today, the Home has 38 residents of all races and religion living under one roof they called “HOME”. The Management Council is looking into new applications for admission to the Home and hope to raise the number of residents to 45.",jch.rcj1@gmail.com,Johor Cheshire Home,http://www.facebook.com/Johore-Cheshire-Home-%E6%9F%94%E4%BD%9B%E6%B5%8E%E4%B8%96%E4%B9%8B%E5%AE%B6-793813674004172,,

The Society of Interpreters for the Deaf in Selangor and the Federal Territory, more often known by its acronym S.I.D., is a registered non-profit and non-governmental voluntary organisation founded in 1990. S.I.D. takes on the mission to serve as interpreters on the educational, judicial and other various fronts to enable the Deaf and Hard of Hearing Community an opportunity of equal rights and access to information and communication. S.I.D. also provides a platform for interpreters to share and exchange ideas on issues relating to interpreting.
Our services
Over the years S.I.D. has explored into other areas of services and development for the Deaf community. One of the areas that S.I.D. recognises is the importance of providing education for the advancement of Deaf/Hard of Hearing children and youths.
In response to the growing needs of these children and youths in and around the Klang Valley, as well as those from other states, S.I.D. set up the Community Service Centre for the Deaf — CSCD in December 1995.
CSCD is challenged in addressing the needs of these children and youths as an individual; unique and special, and in contributing to the development of the child as s/he evolves to become a total person and a contributing member of the society.
CSCD is more than a place where the Deaf strive to achieve equal, if not better grades, than their hearing counterparts. It is a centre where students are nurtured in their educational philosophy to broaden their horizons. The hearing society is encouraged to train the young Deaf /Hard of Hearing in attractive and technically oriented occupations and offer them career prospects. To pave the way to a successful career for these young individuals, the centre also endeavours to train them so that they can adapt in the occupational world. This philosophy is built on the belief that good education, career advice and guidance on the choice of occupation will help prepare them to meet the challenges of the workplace when they leave the centre.
The centre has 50 students, with a team of 10 facilitators, assistant facilitators, office assistants and general helpers. These students range from five years old to 20 years old.
S.I.D/CSCD is gearing towards providing an Integrated Programme for the children and youths, to motivate and guide them on a journey of self-discovery and total development. This includes:
Our needs
Annually S.I.D. requires approximately RM156,000 for its operational costs. The bulk of its funds are raised through public donations and government funding to carry out its activities. As S.I.D. relies largely on public funding, the public is given the opportunity to play a part in charity work as we believe their involvement is important. You could also assist us by providing some resources. We must recognise that our world is ever changing and has been enriched with new technological advancements and challenges. Thus, there are new skills to master, new information to learn, and new perspectives to be gained.

A disability will never, through rehabilitation result in miraculous cure but it affects a recovery towards the ability to live again: to live a more meaningful life, at times independently of others and self-sufficiency within disability. This is rehabilitation.
The main components of rehabilitation comprises of: Treatment (medical, surgical and therapeutic); Education (public awareness and assessment of academic ability); Social integration; Economic habitation (self sufficiency, employment and engagement in small trade and businesses); Skills training & development (transfer of grass root training to caregivers; and enrolment of children into normal schools.
The Community Based Rehabilitation practised by YSIS is also unique in that we do not solely depend of referrals from doctors or hospitals but attend to any individual who walks in for assistance, or is referred to us by the public. Any call for assistance in rehabilitative care through the press is immediately acted upon.
Upon registration (our current number totals 3, 853) the disabled patients’ remaining ability against his disability is assessed using this multidisciplinary approach. A consensus decision is made on the realistic goals that can be achieved by the patient within a predicted period of time.

The National Association of the Deaf (NAD) is the nation’s premier civil rights organisation of, by and for deaf and hard of hearing individuals in the United States of America.
Established in 1880, the NAD was shaped by deaf leaders who believed in the right of the American deaf community to use sign language, to congregate on issues important to them, and to have its interests represented at the national level. These beliefs remain true to this day, with American Sign Language as a core value.
The advocacy scope of the NAD is broad, covering a lifetime and impacting future generations in the areas of early intervention, education, employment, health care, technology, telecommunications, youth leadership, and more – improving the lives of millions of deaf and hard of hearing Americans. The NAD also carries out its federal advocacy work through coalition efforts with specialized national deaf and hard of hearing organisations, as well as coalitions representing national cross-disability organisations.
On the international front, the NAD represents the United States of America to the World Federation of the Deaf (WFD), an international human rights organisation.
Individual and organisational membership makes it possible for the NAD to ensure that the collective interests of the American deaf and hard of hearing community are seen and represented among our nation’s policy makers and opinion leaders at the federal level.

Spastic Children’s Association of Johor is a non-governmental organisation. The Spastic Children Association of Johor is the only Centre in Johor that provides special education, therapeutic rehabilitation, vocational training and also manages a sheltered workshop. We cater these services for children afflicted with cerebral palsy, commonly referred to as spasticity.
Our needs
We require annual expenses of RM1.5 million, most of which goes towards salaries for the therapists, teachers and support staff. The State Government and Ministry of Social Welfare grant us about RM470,000 annually. Being a non-government charitable organisation, we are expected to raise the balance ourselves. Hence, we try to raise funds by renting of the Hall and Seminar Room. The rest comes from fund raising projects and public donations.
Spastic Children’s Association Johor (SCAJ) strive the best to provide sufficient facilities with our scarce resources to maximise its rehabilitation programme. We need more professional care givers, latest equipment and technologies.

Background:
In believing that it is possible, Madam Liu Hsia (alias Xinglin-Zi) and her fervent friends founded the Eden Welfare Foundation in 1982 for the millions of disabled in Taiwan.
On May 24th, 1991, Mr. And Mrs. Ch’ng Joo Beng extended the spirit of Taiwan Eden to Malaysia and set up the Eden Handicap Service Center in Penang.
Transforming a caring heart into a channel of blessing, Taiwan Eden officially established the Double Blessing (Shuang Fu) International Dispatch Center in the year 2000. In cooperation with the internationalization of Taiwan Eden’s ministry, the ministry of Kuala Lumpur has also been renamed “Double Blessing”.
About Shuang Fu:
The ultimate aim of setting up the Shuang Fu (Double Blessing) is to complement the effort of the Government to enrich the lives of the disabled through training and building up their self confidence.
It was fonded by Madam Shen Chiu Hsiang, who is a disabled person herself and her husband Rev. Ch’ng Joo Beng. With their years of experience at the Eden Handicap Service Centre, Penang, where they were involved in promoting the well-being for the disabled, Shuang Fu was set up and commenced to operate in October 2000.It was officially declared open by Datuk Seri Dr. Fong Chan Onn, the Minister of Human Resources Ministry, Malaysia on 19th August 2001. Shuang Fu is a charitable organisation registered with the registrar of Society under the Societies’ Act 1966.
 
Our Aims:- 
Shuang Fu aims to help disabled persons and former drug addicts to achieve a breakthrough in their lives by teaching them suitable vocational skills to enable them to have better job opportunities. With self-sufficiency and self-confidence they would hopefully be reintegrated into society.
To achieve optimum results, Shuang Fu has provided services such as vocational training including handicraft, recycling, computer skills, job placement, and counseling without any charge to the disabled and underprivileged. The Shuang fu programs are open to all, regardless of race or religion.
Our 3 main Directions:-
“Instead of Giving Fish, We Teach How to Fish”

Registrar of Societies: No: 1147
Established: 6th September 2001
In 1999, a few of us with disabilities decided that the way forward is to take more control of our lives and to work towards equal opportunities, self-respect and self-determination. The result of that meeting together was the birth of the Independent Living & Training Centre to promote Independent Living movement within Malaysia.
Independent Living and Training Centre Malaysia is a charitable organization and was established in September 2001, which was formed BY the disabled and FOR the disabled to provide free services for their members who are living throughout the county for more than twelve (12) years.

Needed for specific projects – out door programmes & activities.
The ILTC Malaysia is a non-profit and voluntary organization, and is entirely run on charity and depends mainly on the public support to carry out its work. Therefore we are always seeking funds and volunteers to help us to achieve our aims and objectives.
All these services are presently being provided free to more than one hundred and ninety six (196) non-resident trainees whom we are assisting to lead an independent live. Besides those regular training programs, we also provide food and lodging to fifteen (15) resident-trainees.
We therefore need to raise funds approximately RM 120,000.00 to maintain and continue the programs and training to the disabled community.
The Patron of ILTC is the Former Rawang State Assemblyman Dato’ Tang See Hang had donated a piece of land located at Kampung Sungai Dua Tambahan in Rawang, Selangor Darul Eshan to build our training centre and while ILTC added this by buying an additional two (2) lots with comprises total land 13,400 Sqft.
To date, ILTC needs approximately for the entire project is RM950,000.00 to erect the building with facilities suitable to carry out our activities. At the moment, the ILTC building committees have raised funds more than RM550,000.00 through various projects. However, it is still short of another RM400,000.00 Therefore we need to raise more funds to construct ILTC building to enable all our activities under a more conducive environment with a new building of more than 7000 Sqft was taken up for construction.

The Kiwanis Down Syndrome Foundation is committed to the welfare of children with Down Syndrome, its main focus being the education of these children up to six years old.
Our activities

Its activities are geared toward the setting up and management of Centres of Education for Children with Down Syndrome up to 6 years old where emphasis is on:
The JB Centre was opened on September 1991. The JB Centre became the second centre of its kind under the KDSF. The centre first opened its doors with nine children and two teachers. It operated from a rented premise at Jalan Abdul Samad. In 1996, in recognition of the sincerity and steadfast commitment of the club to its community projects, the State Social Welfare Department of Johor allocated a rent-free building to JB Club to undertake the Early Intervention Programme for children with Down Syndrome. The KDSF JB Centre has been operating at 2C Jln Yahya Awal since and has been growing steadily over the past years. The incremental enrolment of children over the years has signalled the need for the centre’s expansion. Hence finding a suitable site and building of its own has become the immediate focus of the management committee

The Pusat Penjagaan Kanak-Kanak Cacat Taman Megah was initiated in 1997 and was founded by S.K. Manikumar, the late husband of PPKKCTM’s President R. Umah Devi and provides services to physically handicapped and disabled children. The Star reports in March 2009 (The Star report) that there are about 140 multi-racial residents, whose ages range from one month to 55 years old.
While most have some form of disability like cerebral palsy, Down syndrome, hydrocephalus, microcephalous, autism, neurofibromatosis, apeth syndrome, vision impairment or are slow learners or physically and mentally challenged, there are also some who come from broken or single parent homes.
Our needs

Volunteers are very welcome. The Pusat attracts visitors and volunteers from all walks of life college students, corporate bodies, religious groups, humanitarian aid groups, the list is endless. All are impressed by the cleanliness and level of care given. Students from Mara and MAHSA do their practical training in occupational and physiotherapy at the Pusat.
However, the Pusat children, like us, are in need of love and attention, education and entertainment. The Pusat is constantly looking out for volunteers who are willing to spend some of their own precious time each week to:
-coach the normal but underprivileged in their school work;
-organise educational activities
-organise music classes (Piano, Guitar)
-organise sports activities
-organise art classes, sewing classes etc
 If you can provide any of the above, you can bring countless joy to all of them.
Needless to say, they do not possess the financial strength to complete their project alone. Therefore, the Pusat welcomes donors and any form of assistance from kind hearted souls.
All donations would be tax-exempt.

Yayasan Pemulihan Orang-orang Cacat Kelantan is a charitable foundation established to alleviate the plight of the people with disabilities and to give them a meaningful life. The new building of the Yayasan, which was funded by donation was officially opened in year 2000. The Yayasan is the brainchild of the chairman of the board of trustees; the result of his compassion for the local disabled community.
There are over over thousands of disabled persons registered with the Department of Social Welfare in Kelantan. However it is believed that there are many who has not yet registered. Thus Yayasan aims to reach all disabled persons in Kelantan.
Our services
The Yayasan helps the disabled through various activities such as rehabilitation, therapy, home visits to the disabled person’s house, and social and sporting activities. In fact in three years the Yayasan has been able to assist in the establishment of numerous centres to allow greater access to rehabilitation programmes for people in remote areas in the State.
The Yayasan hopes to do more but as their services are free of charge, they are faced with financial constraints. Thus contribution from the public is a necessity to sustain their existence.
Our objectives

Our programmes

New Horizons was birthed as a result of the coming together of a group of like-minded individuals who saw a great need to provide practical help to an ever increasing number of children with learning disabilities. The Canning Garden EIP Centre opened in March 1995, providing an “early intervention programme” (or EIP) for children aged 6 months to 6 years old. Subsequently, the programme expanded to cater to young ‘home-based’ children who could not attend lessons at the centre due to various circumstances. Due to the high demand for services and long waiting list for places, the Pengkalan EIP Centre was started in July 2003. Subsequently, the third centre, the CHILD EIP Centre was opened in Taiping, Perak, in June 2010.
Our services
All services provided are based on needs; no distinction is made based on sex, race, religion or financial background. There are no fees payable, only free-will donations from the families involved.
New Horizons Society, being a non-profit service-provider NGO, is entirely dependent on public donations to fund its programs. To prevent sudden stoppage of services due to a lack of incoming funds in unforeseen circumstances, New Horizons Society practices prudent financial management with a healthy spread between spending and saving.
The core service of New Horizons is to provide the Early Intervention Programme (EIP) to children with learning disabilities, mostly with autistic or Down –syndrome backgrounds. The EIP seeks to instill a broad range of skills over time : academic learning, self-help & living skills, behaviour modification, counselling for affected families, etc. To date, 350 children with learning disabilities have gone through and benefited from the EIP, with most of them in the program for 5 to 10 years.
Our needs
1) Donations – in cash or in kind (teaching aids ,educational toys in good condition) The Society is always in need of funds to help finance their on-going projects
2) Volunteers are constantly needed to help in the projects undertaken. They will be needed to help in the setting up of the Resource Centre – the wrapping of books, recording, helping out with the making of teaching aids etc

The Association of Resource and Education for Autistic Children set up in 1987, also known as Lions REACH, provides free services for autistic children and their families. The centre is manned by a few dedicated and committed Lions and supported by the public and the Lions family throughout Malaysia. From a small group of four children, our centre is now offering free services to more than 55 children, ranging from 3 years old to 21 years old. We have also started another centre in Butterworth since 1998, to meet the increasing needs from the northern region in Malaysia. Both of our centres have been providing 16 programmes to the autistic children and their families.
Our programmes

Group programmes
1. Music and Play Sessions
We provide music and play sessions weekly for the children. In this programme, we use music and play to help the children develop language, social and motor skills. With the increasing number of children in our Centre, we now have two sessions of music and play per week. One group is for children of less than six years old and another for children above six years old.
2. Pre-vocational Programme
We have a pre-vocational programme where we use art and craft to enhance aesthetic values of the children by stimulating their visual, emotional and sensory abilities. This also helps in promoting good working habits and the ability to earn a source of income.
3. Story Telling Session
Story telling session is conducted once a month. The volunteers use stories to stimulate the autistic children in developing language and social skills through listening and communication.
4. Sunday Group Therapy
We hold Sunday group therapy weekly. This programme is aim to create opportunities for the children to socialize and interact with each other and also to learn living skills such as household work, handicraft, woodwork and preparing their own meals. Parents or any family members are required to be with the children so as to provide support for each other and to receive training on how to handle their children. This session is fully conducted by parents of our Centre with the help ofsome volunteers.
5. Snoezelen Room
This therapeutic room is a programme that has been implemented to provide an environment for tranquility and relaxation through visual, auditory and touch stimulation. The gentle stimulation has a soothing effect that helps reduce temper tantrums and agitation in the autistic child.
6. Respite Care Programme
We provide the opportunity for parents to take temporary charge of other autistic child so that the child’s own parents may have a break or holiday. It promotes understanding and support for each other’s child. We organise camping outing to train the children to be self-reliance.
Individual programmes
7. One-to-one learning programme – Monday to Friday
We provide individual teaching-learning programme for the children and in accordance to a tailored curriculum for each child. The teaching curriculum covers four aspects of development such as mental and language skills, social skills, personal and self-help skills and motor skills.
8. Computer Classes
We have computer classes daily for our children with the aim to integrate these children into the new information era by introducing educational programmes via computer to help them improve their language development, concept learning, motor skills, psychosocial skills and motor co-ordination. This programme also hopes to build and strengthen the thinking capacity of autistic children by using computer simulated pictures in a structured manner.
9. Art Camp; Creativity Programme
We plan to stimulate and enrich the children’s imaginations and expressions. This is achieved through flashing pictures and art pieces on the computer accompanied by a relevant piece of music. The children are encouraged to give an account of what they feel and imagine. The sound track is important here for it draws our different emotions in different children and we try to make sense of why the child responds in that manner. This programme serves as an area for research effort to uncover the thinking patterns of our autistic children to help us understand them better.
There is also an art class to encourage the children to experiment with colours and express creatively.
Other services

10. Diagnostic and Development Assessment
We provide free diagnostic and developmental assessment for the children. Diagnostic assessment is used to confirm if the child is autistic and developmental assessment is carried out to assess the developmental stages of the child.
11. Library and other resources
Our library has resources that include printed, audio and visual materials on autism. These are provided for the use of families of autistic children.
12. Awareness Programme
We are strong and persistent advocates for autistic children. We conduct road shows, exhibitions and talks to promote more understanding about autism.
13. Training Sessions
We organise training sessions for parents, volunteers, teachers and public. On going in house training is carried out over the years. We recruit and invite professionals and experts to run seminars and workshops for parents, volunteers and teachers in the hope that everyone will be equipped with the knowledge and skills to cope with the autistic children. We also run seminars for institutions who would like to understand autism. We have also been providing fieldwork training for the medical students from Penang Medical College so that the students may have a better understanding on autism.
14. Counselling Programme
We provide counselling for parents and family members of autistic children. The counselling is design specifically for parents and family members to meet with counselor to discuss problems or issues they are facing when handling the autistic child.
15. Parent Support Group
We have a parent support group who meet to provide support and assistance to each other. This is where parents could come in to discuss the progress of their children and organise social activities amongst themselves.
16. Research
Research is essential in the REACh approach. Research serves to update treatment and intervention methods. Data collected over the years of practice can be rationalized, put on strong scientific foundations and disseminated to help other caring groups all over the world. Currently we are conducting studies in the following areas:
All the above services and programmes have been made possible because of the kind and generous support from the members of the Lions family and the public. The supports have enabled us to continue FREE services for the autistic children and their families, and move ahead to further improve our services.
It is our hope that we could extend our services to all autistic children in Malaysia. Our vision is to become the source of information, training and motivation for parents of autistic children throughout Malaysia. We hope to become a Centre of research for autism in Malaysia.

Jesteru kewujudan Pertubuhan Kebajikan Baitul Kasih adalah untuk memberi perlindungan kepada anak-anak yang kurang bernasib baik ini agar mereka tidak terjebak kepada gejala negative ini disebabkan oleh status kedhaifan mereka di dalam masyarakat.
Pertubuhan Kebajikan Baitul Kasihi berhasrat membina hubungan yang erat dengan semua kelompok masyarakat agar dapat menjadikan bertolong bantu sebagai satu agenda utama dalam mencapai tahap hidup yang bahagia di dunia dan di akhirat. Hubungan sebegini akan mendorong golongan kaya berperanan sebagai ‘bank kepada masyarakat’ dan mereka mampu untuk menyelesaikan masalah golongan-golongan dhaif, orang-orang miskin dan yang memerlukan. Pada ketika itu suasana masyarakat yang berkasih sayang akan menjadi meriah dan indah dengan sifat saling membantu, bekerjasama dan bergotong royong.
Masyarakat Islam akan cepat maju dan kasih sayang terjalin sesama insan. Hubungan dengan yang kaya dan yang miskin rapat. Tiada jurang perbezaan sesama insan dan tiada lagi jenayah serta gejala sosial berlaku akibat dari tekanan dan kesusahan hidup. Akhirnya wujudlah perpaduan dan kerjasama. Masalah dalam masyarakat dapat di selesaikan kesan dari pemurahnya orang kaya dan kesan daripada tawadhuknya mereka. Inilah masyarakat yang diidam-idamkan oleh semua bangsa dan agama.

Konsep
RTH merupakan satu inovasi dalam penjagaan kanak-kanak yang tiada keluarga kandung dengan menempatkan 8 hingga 10 orang kanak-kanak dalam sebuah rumah biasa yang lebih kondusif, berbanding meletakan mereka di Rumah Kanak-kanak sedia ada. Mereka diberi penjagaan dan perlindungan oleh penjaga yang telah dilantik oleh Jabatan Kebajikan Masyarakat sebagai ibu bapa pelihara mereka. Disamping berpeluang membesar dalam suasana kekeluargaan, mereka dididik mengikut kepercayaan agama dan budaya masing-masing.
Sejarah awal
Rumah Tunas Harapan pertama telah dibina pada tahun 1988   di atas sebidang tanah rizab kebajkan seluas 12 ekar, pemberian daripada kerajaan Negeri Selangor. Kos pembinaan bagi 4 unit rumah sebanyak RM300,000 telah ditaja oleh Syarikat Amway (M) Sdn. Bhd. 10 orang kanak-kanak telah ditempatkan bersama satu keluarga pelihara di setiap rumah. Pada tahun 1998, 2 unit tambahan telah dibina menjadikan keseluruhan sebanyak 6 unit Rumah Tunas Harapan dan dinamakan Rumah Tunas Harapan (RTH) Tengku Ampuan Rahimah, Kuala Selangor.

Oleh kerana banyak masalah yang di hadapi seperti penyewaan rumah tertunggak sehingga beberapa bulan lamanya dan kanak2 disini makan nasi berlaukan kicap sahaja dan tidak dapat di layan dengan sempurna. Kami mengambil anisiatif sendiri bagi mengumpulkan sukarelawan menganggotai ahli jawatan kuasa baru yang terdiri dari Jemaah Surau dan Mesjid sekitarannya, dan badan2 korporat yang kerap kali membantu rumah ini pada mulanya bagi menjalankan aktiviti memperkukuhkan persatuan ini. Pada 15hb Mei 2005 Jab. Kebajikan Masyarakat telah memberikan kata putus untuk menutup Asrama ini, kerana banyak masalah yg di hadapi tidak di ambil perhatian serious oleh pentadbiran yang lalu.. Oleh yang demikian pada tanggal 18 Mei 2005 satu AJK yang terdiri dari 12 orang telah bermesyuarat dan melantik AJK bagi mengantikan dan mengendalikan rumah ini. Oleh kerana asrama ini tidak berdaftar dengan perdaftaran pertubuhan kami mengambil anisiatif sekali lagi dengan mendaftar persatuan ini atas nama baru Penubuhan Kebajikan Rumah Silaturrahim Nurul Qanaah. Terdapat 4 ketogeri kanak-kanak yang di ambil perhatian iaitu Kanak-kanak Yatim, Kanak-kanak terbiar, Kanak-kanak Muallaf dan kanak-kanak miskin yang keluarga mereka tidak mampu mendidik dan menyekolahkan mereka buat masa ini.
Perkara-perkara yang telah di ambil perhatian dalam menyusun & mengemas kini pentadbiran selama 5 bulan lebih adalah seperti berikut:
1. Memindahkan rumah pertubuhan ini kesatu kawasan / tempat yg lebih selesa, sesuai dan selamat di duduki yang sekarang berpengkalan di No 34 A/B Jln 10 Taman Batu off Taman Greenwood, Bt Cave Gombak, Selangor.
2.  Mencari dana kewangan semasa untuk keperluan harian / mingguan dan bulanan kanak-kanak di sini. Kami menanggaran kos penyelenggaraan adalah sebanyak RM 10,000 sebulan di perlukan untuk operasi harian bagi menampung keperluan seperti sewaan rumah, bas sekolah, Belanja sekolah, Bil Api / Air dll. Kerana dgn tiadanya pendapatan tetap dan saluran dari mana-mana pihak oleh yang demikian kami memerlukan bantuan dari sesiapa juga yang ingin mengulurkan sumbangan terhadap pertubuhan ini. Dengan sumbangan yang berterusan sahajalah rumah dan kanak-kanak ini mendapat penjagaan yang rapi dan teratur. Oleh yang demikian saya menyeru kepada sesiapa sahaja untuk turut menjadi penyumbang baik dari segi peralatan ataupun kewangan bagi memastikan ianya terus teraju bagi membela nasib kanak-kanak disini dari masa kesemasa. Kami juga telah pun membuka satu akaun bank di BIMB cawangan Tabung haji yang mana salah seorang AJK rumah ini adalah pengurus kepada bank ini. Ini dapat di buktikan bahawa dgn ketelusan kami menguruskan rumah ini terdapat 4 pemegang amanah dan penama yg terdiri dari saya sendiri, Setiausaha dan kedua-dua bendahari adalah sebagai wakil bagi menandatagani setiap cek keluar masuk. Dan setiap pengeluaran akan di catat bukan sahaja melalui buka lager atau buku simpan kira tetapi di dalam setiap minit mesyuarat mingguan kami. Keputusan yang di buat bukan sahaja di tangan saya tapi kami selaku AJK semua bertanggungjawab membuat keputusan atas setiap apa aktiviti yang kami jalankan dari masa kesemasa.
3. Kami juga telah mendaftarkan pertubuhan ini ke Jab. Perdaftaran Pertubuhan dan sekarang ini telah kelulusan dari pihak terbabit. No pendaftaran Pertubuhan ini bernombor 1698-05-7. Dari daya usaha kedua-dua setiausaha kami, En Mohd Ishak Zainuddin dan Hj Sujono proses ini dapat dijalankan dengan baik, tepat dan lancar.
4. Begitu juga ucapan yang tidak terhingga kepada pengelola atau penyelia rumah ini yakni Puan Esah yg tidak jemu-jemu melayan karenah kanak-kanak ini hingga dan setiap tetamu yg hadir mengucapkan syabas atas disiplin yang tinggi yang di tunjukkan oleh kanak-kanak di sini. Alhamdulillah
5.  Saya juga mengalu-alukan sesiapa sahaja yang ingin tampil bagi membantu dari segi tenaga bagi menyumbangkan buah fikiran dan tenaga bagi mengisi borang yang di sediakan di halaman web ini bagi kita sama-sama membangunkan rumah ini dengan berterusan.

What We Do
Rumah KIDS provides food, shelter, clothing, education, tender care and discipline to orphans and abandoned children. With the increase of children facing such harsh environments, these young lives are given the opportunities to find peace and security here in their growing up years.
Here, the children find a new family and make new friends in loving surroundings. They settle into a healthy routine of study, play and rest, supervised daily by caring house-parents. Beyond providing the children’s basic needs of food, clothing, shelter and education, Rumah KIDS also cares for the spiritual and mental development of every child. With firm and tender care, young battered lives are mended, loved and nurtured back to physical, mental and emotional health. Presently, Rumah KIDS shelters more than 60 children in four separate houses (two houses in Klang and two houses in Subang Jaya) with seven staff and two part time workers and volunteers to look after their welfare. In these safe and loving environment, shielded from the violence, abuse and neglect they once knew, many of these children grow up in the home, finish their education and are empowered to lead productive lives.",jansenrumahkids@gmail.com,Persatuan Rumah Kanak-Kanak  Ini Disayangi (KIDS),http://www.rumahkids.com,,

The main activities are channelled through Pusat Jagaan Kamakshi Development Centre (KDC) and Pusat Jagaan Kamakshi Child Home (KCH). Pusat Jagaan Kamakshi Child Rehabilitation Centre caters to children with physical and/or mental disabilities. We currently have 160 registered children here in the centre.
The method(s) used to rehabilitate the children to normalcy are Physiotherapy and/or Occupational Therapy for children with physical disabilities such as Cerebral Palsy and Spina Bifida. Children with learning disabilities such as Dyslexia, Down Syndrome and Autism receive special education that are customised to meet the specific needs of each child. In addition, our centre also provides Play Therapy using the ‘i-Play’ Toy Library. This consists of many different custom-made toys that are specially produced to assist with the learning process of traumatised and abused children.
Pusat Jagaan Kamakshi Child Home (KCH) commenced in 2005 in semi-D house. At present we have six(6) semi-D houses and all our activities are spread over these houses. These houses, are divided into day–care rehabilitation centre, prayer hall, computer laboratory, girls dormitory, boys dormitory and kitchen.

We also intend to have an indoor activity centre which will be able to accommodate more than a hundred children of both genders. Our aim is to try to equip every child with at least a basic degree and holistic living skills before he or she leaves the home. In the meantime, children with disabilities who have undergone the rehabilitation program are expected to have a self-satisfying life with high self-esteem, self-pride and self- confidence.",karnakamachi@gmail.com ,Persatuan Kebajikan Dan Sosial  Kamakshi Wilayah Utara  (Pusat Jagaan Kamakshi Child  Home),http://kamakshichildhome.org/,,

It aims to give every orphan and abandoned baby a chance to feel love and care in the security of a family in accordance to our tag-line:
We work closely with the Ministry of Women, Family and Community Development to expedite the adoption process whereby abandoned babies and children in orphanages are quickly matched up and placed with suitable parents.There is a disturbingly high number of orphans and unwanted babies placed in orphanages which is surprising considering that there are many couples who wish to adopt.
OrphanCARE is perhaps the only NGO seeking to reduce the number of children in orphanages. Most orphanages are often ill-resourced to provide children the kind of love, attention and security that could be offered by families. Orphans and children who spend large parts of their childhood in orphanages often grow up with low self esteem resulting in behavioural problems, delinquency and poor academic performance. Many leave orphanages at the age of 18 without a family support system making it difficult for them to make a good start in life.
OrphanCARE aims to help change society’s mindset towards orphans, recognizing that children should not be left permanently in orphanages which should really only be ‘transit points’ before they are placed with families who can bring them up in a proper family structure.
There are an increasing numbers of babies left in waste dumps, bushes, drains, public toilets among other places. Unwed mothers or victims of rape who abandon their babies are mostly young and come under pressure arising from social stigma and legal implications, compounded by a sense of hopelessness due to not knowing whom to turn to.
Our baby hatch, the first such facility in Malaysia, was set up to discourage women from abandoning their babies by providing the assurance that the babies would be placed in good homes.
OrphanCARE has a database of screened adoptive parents with complete background profiles and work with other Government departments, NGOs and members of the public to provide suitable families for orphans and abandoned babies.",admin@orphancare.org.my,OrphanCARE,http://www.orphancare.org.my,,

Pencetus pemikiran menubuhkan Badan Khidmat Islam Perak atau BAKIP awalan tahun 1984, oleh Allahyarham YB Dato’ Haji Mior Aris Meor Abu Bakar selaku Pengerusi Jawatankuasa Hal Ehwal Agama Islam Perak dan Allahyarham Ybhg. Dato’ Haji Osman Baki masa itu yang Dipertua Majlis dan Jabatan Hal Ehwal Agama Islam Perak dengan dibantu oleh beberapa orang tokoh – tokoh agama dan kenamaan yang berprihatin untuk mewujudkan sebuah badan sukarela bagi membantu meringankan tugas – tugas yang dilaksanakan oleh pihak MAIPK. Mereka – mereka yang merangka aktiviti BAKIP iaitu Ybhg, Dato’ Haji Zainal Abidin Haji Abd Kadir (Timbalan Pengerusi ), Tuan Haji Anwar Bin Meor Hamzah (Naib Pengerusi) AF, Sheikh Haji Mohd Nor Al Hafiz (Setiausaha), Ybhg, Dato’ Haji Ahmad Dato Haji Ismail (jawatankuasa), Tuan Haji Mohd Helmi Abdullah dan beberapa nama, tapi yang lebih berperanan penting wujudnya BAKIP ini adalah Allahyarham Dato Seri Haji Ahmad Said (Bekas Menteri Besar Perak), maka dirangka tugas yang akan dilaksanakan BAKIP untuk perkhidmatan masyarakat Islam khususnya, iaitu :
Objektif kami
Pernah suatu masa dahulu BAKIP telah diberi kepercayaan oleh MAIPK. Melaksanakan tugas – tugas dalam bentuk menyampaikan sumbangan kewangan kepada golongan fakir – fakir miskin setiap daerah – daerah yang sepatutnya dilakukan oleh pihak Baitulmal, begitu juga menguruskan jenazah yang tidak berwaris juga dilaksanakan sehingga kini masih dikekalkan seorang petugas yang dibayar gaji bulanan, ditempatkan di Hospital Ipoh.
Bagi memperluaskan aktiviti, BAKIP telah diperuntukkan sebuah rumah kerajaan di No 133, Jalan Sultan Abdul Jalil, Greentown, Ipoh untuk dijadikan penempatan anak – anak yatim yang daif dan memerlukan pembiayaan persekolahan. Maka pada tahun 1986, bermula era pembelaan nasib anak – anak yatim yang dilaksanakan, dengan pengambilan sulung seramai 38 orang lelaki.
Pada tahun 1988, kemasukan peringkat ke dua diambil seramai 28 orang perempuan, pengambilan dilakukan secara berperingkat – peringkat berterusan sehingga kini hampir seramai 1500 org lelaki/ perempuan telah dibiayai dengan sempurna mengharungi kehidupan sendiri sekarang.
Setakat ini pemerhatian dari pihak – pihak tertentu seperti Kerajaan Negeri, Pusat, Agensi Kerajaan / Swasta serta badan – badan berkanun telah tampil memberikan sumbangan, samada kewangan , peralatan dan sebagainya, umpama sebuah bas telah disumbangkan oleh Yayasan Kebajikan Negara Malaysia dengan nilai RM110’000 dan dua buah van untuk kegunaan pengangkutan anak – anak yatim ke sekolah dengan bayaran cukai jalan secara percuma oleh Jabatan Pengangkutan Jalan melalui Kementerian Pengangkutan.
Yb Dato Dr Haji Abd Malek Mohd Hanafiah merupakan pengerusi yang ke empat, pertama Allahyarham Yb Dato Haji Mior Aris Meor Abu Bakar, yang kedua Yb Dato Haji Mohd Razlan Haji Abd Hamid dan yang ketiga Ybhg Dato Haji Mohd Zaim Haji Abd Hasan ( Bekas adun Blanja).

Pada 1995, BAKIP telah didaftarkan sebagai badan sukarela secara langsung dengan Jabatan Pendaftar Pertubuhan, bertujuan untuk menggerakkan BAKIP lebih jauh terutama di bidang ekonomi, berbeza sebelum ini diwujudkan di bawah MAIPK , tetapi hubungan erat tetap terjalin dengan pihak MAIPK kerana kedudukan Pengerusi selaku pemegang Portfolio Exco Hal Ehwal Agama Negeri.
Program kami

Golongan kaya perlu berperanan penting di tengah masyarakat dengan menyelesaikan tuntutan keperluan manusia yang asasi. Merekalah agen pembangunan bagi masyarakat yang aman damai dan harmoni. Orang kaya berfungsi sebagai ‘bank kepada masyarakat’ dan mereka mampu untuk menyelesaikan masalah orang-orang miskin dan yang memerlukan. Oleh kerana dari sifat-sifat pemurah terutamanya daripada orang-orang kaya dan berada, masyarakat Islam terbela. Masyarakat Islam cepat maju, kasih sayang terjalin sesama insan.
Hubungan dengan yang kaya dan yang miskin rapat. Tiada jurang perbezaan sesama insan dan tiada lagi jenayah serta gejala sosial berlaku akibat dari tekanan dan kesusahan hidup. Akhirnya wujudlah perpaduan dan kerjasama. Masalah dalam masyarakat dapat di selesaikan kesan dari pemurahnya orang kaya dan kesan daripada tawadhuknya mereka.

Bermula pada tahun 1940 dengan sebuah madrasah, yang telah di beri nama Madrasah Diniah oleh Tuan Guru Haji Abdul Wahid bin Othman. Pada mulanya Madrasah ini hanya berbumbungkan atap rumbia dan berdindingkan kayu. Berkalan elektrik dan air masih belum ada.Jumlah pelajar pada permulaannya hanya seramai 40 orang sahaja. Murid-murid permulaannya ialah anak-anak kampung sahaja. Pada tahun 1943, barulah Madrasah ini mula menerima pelajar dari luar negeri melaka. Pada tahun 1944, dengan sokongan ahli-ahli kariah dan orang ramai maka dapatlah membina sebuah Madrasah baru yang panjangnya anggaran 120 kaki dan lebar 50 kaki 2 tingkat.Madrasah baru itu, boleh menempatkan 100 orang pelajar. Pada tahun1950, sebuah madrasah perempuan di bina di belakang rumah Tuan Haji Abdul Wahid dengan bangunan 2 tingkat yang boleh menempatkan seramai 60 orang.
Pada tahun 1954, bermulanya usaha memelihara anak-anak yatim dan nama asramanya adalah Darul Aitam. Keluasan asrama tersebut berukuran, 100 kaki dan lebar 40 kaki.

Pada Disember 1960 telah berlaku satu kebakaran yang telah meranapkan dua buah bangunan Madrasah (L/P) termasuk rumah Tuan Guru Hj Abdul Wahid,dan kesemua harta benda tidak dapat di selamatkan.Tidak ada kemalangan nyawa yang telibat di dalam kebakaran tersebut. Pada bulan Mac 1963, Lembaga Pengurusan Kebajikan Anak-anak Yatim dan Miskin telah di daftarkan dengan No.Pendaftaran 1116(Malacca).

Pada tahun, 1966,anak-anak yatim leleki telah di pindahkan ke Madrasah Nuriah.Madrasah itu diuruskan oleh Ust.Hj Jaliludin anak sulung Allahyarham Tuan Guru Hj Abdul Wahid. Pada tahun1991, sebuah bangunan kekal untuk asrama perempuan 3 tingkat telah dapat dibina dari sumber bantuan pihak kerajaan dan orang ramai dengan perbelanjaan RM 400,000,00. Nama ringkas “ PAYASUM ” telah diterima pakai mengikut keputusan mesyuarat Agung kali ke 40 pada tahun 1995. Pada tahun 1996, pihak pengurusan telah dapat membina sebuah dewan makan dengan anggaran kos RM 100,000,00 dari sumber pihak kerajaan dan orang ramai.

The Malaysian Children’s Aid Society (MACAS) was set up to provide short term assistance (usually financial) to families with children when these families face acute financial difficulties due to the recent illness of a child or of a parent. These are often families who have been coping previously but are now having problems caused by either the recent illness or disability or death of a parent who is the main source of income or the additional costs of medical treatment and/or travel costs to hospitals.
Application Process
Applications are forwarded to MACAS by the social workers in hospitals who use application forms that have been prepared by MACAS. If deserving, such financial aid is made available as soon as possible. The MACAS committee meets monthly to vet these applications and funds are usually made available within a week of the meeting to the most deserving families. Such financial aid is limited to six monthly payments. In exceptional cases, aid may be made available for an additional six months.

The Pure Life Society started off as a paper organisation in the year 1949, aiming at promoting multi-racial and multi-religious understanding through lectures and forums and programmes promoting inter-action through inter-faith conventions, services at the Leper settlement, old folks homes, Serendah Boys’ Home and the like.
The Society was registered on 15 July 1950. The Founder-President of the Pure Life Society was Swami Satyananda, who, during the years 1945 to 1951, was involved in relief work among the poor, the orphans and the displaced children both in Singapore and Malaya, assisted by Mother (then Sister) Mangalam. In 1950 the Society found the need to establish a Home for orphans and underprivileged children as a result of World War II, which left, in its wake, several displaced families of widows and orphans. The first few barrack-like buildings were put up in 1952 by the Pure Life Society.
Following H.H. Swami Satyananda’s demise Mother who was then known as Sister Mangalam was appointed President of the organisation in 1961 by virtue of the Society’s Ordinance.
In the year 1957 the Society became a statutory body governed by the Incorporation Ordinance No. 15 of 1957. It is non-sectarian and non-communal, spiritual, cultural, educational and humanitarian in character. Its membership is open to all races and religions. The membership fee for the time being is RM20.00 per year and Life membership is RM300.00.
Our activities
The activities that are carried out under the auspices of the Pure Life Society are two-pronged:
(1) INSaF – the promotion of Inter-faith Spiritual Fellowship (INSaF) by way of forums, seminars and service.
(2) Welfare Home – for children who are orphans / abandoned / neglected / abused / and are from broken families / single parents.",info@purelifesociety.org.my,The Pure Life Society,http://purelifesociety.org.my,,

Recognising that one effective way for these poor families to come out of the cycle of poverty is by empowering their children through education, we ensure that a conducive study and living environment is available for our children.

Rumah amal Gurunatha Aasramam or also known as Gurunatha Aasramam Orphanage. We started with religious classes way back in 1999 in housing estates around Sungai Petani.  It was a two hour class mainly teaching religion to children of all ages.  The first class was in our own house. During this time, the chair person of a temple, Sri Ruthra Veeramuthu Mahamariamman Temple, Jalan Cinta Sayang, 08000 Sungai Petani, approached us to conduct religious classes in the temple and we accepted his request and started religious classes in the temple. The classes were conducted from 8.00 am to 12.45 pm every Friday.
We provided transport, breakfast, lunch and printed notes for the children who attended the classes. We also had holiday camps for the children and public.  During these camps, the children stay with us for 5 days and four nights in the camp sites.  These camps are organised annually.
Chair persons of various temples around Sungai Petani started approaching us to conduct religious classes in their temples.  We accepted the request, on a first come first serve basis, and proceeded to conduct religious classes in Subramaniar Temple, Bandar Baru, Sungai Lalang every Friday from 2.00 pm to 6.00 pm, Mahamariamman Temple, Sungai Tukang every Friday from 6.00 pm to 9.30 pm and Mahamariamman Temple, Taman Keladi every Saturday from 8.00 am to 12.45 pm.  Likewise we also provided transport, breakfast, lunch and printed notes for the children who attended the classes.
We continued with our annual camps without fail.  We started holiday camps in our house whereby we housed 100 over children during the November-December holidays.  These holiday camps were mainly conducted at the request of parents who send their children to our weekly classes who in turn complained to us that their children never stay home during the long school holidays while they are at work.
In the midst of  all these activities, we also participate in camps conducted by NGOs.  During one of these camps is where we had the opportunity to visit a  home in Perlis whereby the children are not allowed to stay in the home after 18 years of age.  These children, if not taken back by their respective family, are left unattended.  We were given the opportunity to talk the Hindu children in the home and managed to help 5 of the children who were 18 and placed them with various families and brought one to our own home.  This was in 2005.  That is how we started the children home that is existing now.
Today we are housing 30 children in our home. Our home comprises of  3 terrace houses.  One for the girls, one for the boys and one is the main dorm where prayers, tuition and other activities are conducted.  Our main concern for the children is discipline and education.
Our vision

1757,,Children,,Ms. Lala Noronha,"How to find us
The shelter is housed in a part/section of the Sekolah Kebangsaan Convent Jesus Infant at Jalan Parameswara, Melaka.
History

These children were originally from Timor Leste where they were displaced after their parents were killed during the internal conflict in the days leading to Timor Leste’s independence in 2002. These children, as young as 2 year old ,were found wondering the streets unaccompanied countless miles from their villages where they had lived before the conflict destroyed their families. Some of these children were severely traumatized as some of them had witness first hand the atrocities on their parents.
The internal unrest in Timor Leste that has occurred since 28 April 2006 and that continues to the present and reinforced the fact that the country continues to need international support. Since 14th of June – 30th of August Loving Timor Leste Children Foundation (FHTO) was very fortunate to have the Malaysian contingent led by Col Ismet Nayan bin Ismail, protecting the children. Twelve Malaysian army personnel resided in FHTO for three and a half months. Then not only gave us protection, they also provided health services to the children and they renovated the house. Now FHTO has a library which called MALCON library. As a result both the visit of the Let. Gen Dato Shahron and of the efforts of the commander Col Ismet Nayan , following the departure of MALCON, FHTO continues to be protected by the Malaysian Police.
Whilst in Timor Leste the Malaysian Army Medical staff identified three children from FHTO needing urgent surgery and other four children need close observation. Marciela Branco and her sister Graciela have both been diagnosed with A.I.S (scoliosis). In addition they identified that the children’s supervisor, Madalena Fernandes who was already hospitalized in the Malaysian Army Clinic in Timor Leste, needs further specialist hospital treatment. Madalena, who has been so loyal to the children over the years, exposing herself to dangerous situations when we needed to search for food for the children has since been diagnosed as having Cryptococcal meningitis , Systemic Lupus Erythematosus and suspected Tuberculosis. The National Hospital of Timor Leste has neither specialist doctors nor facilities for these illnesses. As a small non profit organisation FHTO does not have the necessary financial resources to fund medical attention overseas. Even the best support from MALCON Timor Leste, we still waited against the time as the medical condition of two of the patients worsened and they became very ill.
Finally we had no choice but to take the decision to use what ever resources we had available to us and with the support of MALCON, founder’s family and friend of FHTO sent the three most urgent cases . Marciela and Madalena were admitted to HUKM( Hospital Universitas Kebangsaan Malaysia) where they were being treated Marciela has also been treated for Tuberculosis. They had been in Kuala Lumpur 4 months. Unfortunately there are few kids was left behind in Timor Leste as FHTO could not afford to finance them. Only this time we secured funding to send them (Melina, Marcia, Maria and Melino) to Malaysia for their treatment however the cost of the treatment stills an ongoing problem.
Friends of FHTO are in the process of raising funds to contribute towards the medical cost of our FHTO family in Malaka/ Putra Hospital. One friend Peter Whrathal has agreed to find the funding required paying for any shortfall in the costs of drugs, and prosthesis for the 4 additional patients Melina, Marcia, Maria and Melino.Since 14 February, Valentine day, now 15 Timor Leste children/ youths residing in Malacca for Medical reason and education. However the illnesses of these children are very serious and need ongoing treatment, the cost of the treatments and drugs are not consolable. That now we need additional support from other individual or organization to support these children.
How you can help us
For accounting reasons, the shelter cannot accept funds directly from the public but interested parties could send monetary contribution on their behalf through the Society of Saint Vincent de Paul – SSVP Melaka State Council Project Fund at the Melaka Public Bank Branch (Acct. No. 3142447201). They do welcome donation of items like exercise books and food items like Milo drink mix which to them are considered luxury items that the children would appreciate.
Interested parties can contact Ms. Lala Noronha directly at tlnewgen.malacca@gmail.com to find out what items that the children would need.
Observed by a group of recent visitors, the children appear to be well looked after and had fairly well-provided modest accommodations. They have a small library as well as a few donated computers with internet connection where they could reach out to their friends and remaining family back home as well as around the world through their own written blog which is reachable at http://timorlestenewgeneration.blogspot.com/.
Their monthly groceries are mostly provided by the Society of Saint Vincent de Paul – Melaka State Council Project Fund as well as contribution from the surrounding population. While their basic necessities were currently met, they do still need some funds to pay for traveling and medical cost for treatment that the children still need before they could get better.

Rumah Hope was started in 1994 as a social ministry of Good Hope Lutheran Church, ELCM in aid of five needy children and as a sanctuary for abused, neglected and under-privileged children between the ages of five to 17. The Home relies solely on public funding to maintain itself.
After four years, the Home moved from an old rented bungalow in Old Klang Road to the new home Rumah Hope 1 in Paramount Garden , PJ. The construction of the home was possible thanks to generous contributions in cash and kind namely from Evangelical Lutheran Church Malaysia , Khalid Aluminium Industries Sdn Bhd, NGO’s the general public and various corporate bodies. Rumah Hope 2, a second block was opened on 10th October 2006.  Rumah Hope and Rumah Hope 2 will be able to house a maximum of 70 children. The Home is which is registered with Registrar of Societies is also registered with the Selangor Welfare Council and it has been granted Tax Exemption status by the Ministry of Finance.
Our objectives

Rumah Hope aims to provide a suitable social setting with physical and emotional care to children who have been deprived of these necessities in life. The Home aims to:
 1)Provide a haven (health care, shelter, education and social interaction) to physically, emotionally and psychologically scarred children.
 2)Provide security and comfort to these children who never have experienced tenderness and loving care.
 3)Provide the opportunity to reconcile parent and child from troubled homes through counselling and therapy.
 4)Provide the chance of wholesome education in government schools.
5) Activities like woodwork, sewing and handicraft for the older children are organised.
 Through a sound upbringing and an environment that nurtures, loves and cares, Rumah Hope hopes to provide these children the opportunity to realize their dreams and step out into the world as independent, mature individuals who can be successful in life.
 The Present Management Committee, led by the chairman Jacob Mathew comprises of voluntary members from Good Hope Lutheran Church and other churches under the Evangelical Lutheran Church Malaysia (ELCM) together with individuals from private companies. All the management members are active in public life and are ardent supporters of various public welfare organizations.
 Along with our efforts to secure funds, a request for an annual government grant is being made annually. With government aid backing us, the possibility of extending our reach to more children becomes very real.

1760,"20 Jalan Intan, Taman Ros, Ulu Tiram, Johor",Children,+6017 2088 113 ,Nesam / Devanasam,"Who are we

Puspanesam Home, or Pertubuhan Kebajikan Puspanesam, was registered as a charity home in 2004 by Devanasam David John, 58, a single lady with a big heart for children in need. The shelter started with only three children and went on to accept more who were orphaned and those of single parents who cannot take care of them because of full-time jobs. Her name, Devanasam, translates as “God’s Love” in Tamil and the shelter is named Puspanesam, which has a simple logo of a flower (puspa) set within a heart shape (to represent love).
Born in Ipoh as the ninth child in a family of 15 siblings, Devanasam is familiar with the adversity and challenges faced by a large family. She was a sickly child who suffered from asthma. Since she was often absent from school, her parents decided to drop her out of school when she was 16. Her love for children led her to work at her church, teaching Sunday School classes in Tamil and English. After seven years of working with the children, the church asked her to work as a clerk in the office and she had the opportunity to learn typewriting and office skills.
She continued to be involved with the church’s social work and spent two years helping out at a kindergarten in an estate. Over the years, Devanasam felt the call to help needy children but it was in the mid 1990s, when she moved to live in Johor Baru, that an unexpected turn of events brought the first three children to her. “God emptied me and filled me up,” said Devanasam, describing her long involvement with social work and helping children that led to a fulfilling job in running a shelter for children in Ulu Tiram. The boys and girls aged between 4 and 14 are orphans or from broken homes. Those who have never known a mother’s love are especially needy and they are cared for like her own.
She started the shelter in a rented single-storey terrace house and when the number of children increased, she expanded the shelter into the adjacent house. When troubled women with young children sought her help, Devanasam accepted them into the shelter. “So far three families have been united,” said Devanasam about how the husband and wife were counselled and left afterwards with their children to live as a family again.
When several middle-aged women were accepted into the shelter, the living arrangements had to be reorganised. Abandoned by their families, they were depressed and needed help. Now the children are housed in a separate single-storey semi-detached house while the two units of linked single-storey terrace houses shelter abandoned women and the office and store. “The children who are not academically strong are encouraged to be trained in tailoring, beauty care and cooking skills,” she said. They have started a tailoring class. An instructor comes in to teach the women and girls on Saturday mornings. However, there are difficulties as they have only one manual and one electric sewing machine.
Devanasam is grateful for the help she is receiving from regular sponsors who pay the monthly rent for the two units of terrace houses and contribute towards the payment of expenses. The expenses of the shelter amount to RM6,000 per month. The sum covers the rental of the semi-detached house, utility bills, food, school transport fees and other basic necessities. Aware of their need, the landlord of the semi-detached house has given them permission to make the necessary building renovations to accommodate the children more comfortably. While there are plans to extend the building, mend the fences and install a large water tank which someone had donated, they are short of funds. At the moment they are managing with their limited resources but Devanasam maintains that a consistent water supply is essential for a house full of children.

Berkat Children’s Home is created for ministering and caring for the deprived, suffering children in the community, restoring broken lives of innocent victims caused by tragedy, impoverished and abused.
Berkat Children’s Home strives to create a home like atmosphere with house parents as role models, social workers to help and assist in restoring the family life and activities. The children arrive at our home with confusion and the feeling of not being wanted, often depraved of love, proper shelter and nourishment. These children were removed from their home because of derelict parents, or have suffered the heartbreak of a home shattered by divorce, run away parents, abandoned or had tragically lost one or both parents. These are the majority of the children admitted at Berkat Children’s Home.
To undo the violent tragedy that has happened to the children takes a process of tender loving care and a health environment. To add to the healing process, we have in placed a therapeutic practical education for the children and also a group of volunteer tuition teachers to help in the formal education. We believe that these are vital for the growth of each child. We continuously work towards providing a Home like atmosphere that the children can call their own. We provide a parent-child relationship and to build brotherhood among the children, equipping them in their growth towards adulthood. Berkat Children’s Home is a home for them.
Berkat Children’s Home is non-profit organization, set up to help underprivileged children for all walks of life, race and religion.

The home was first founded in 1891 and was then known as St Joseph’s Orphanage. With the changing trends in society in the 1990’s and the rise in problems faced by families, there was pressure to expand the services of the orphanage in order to be more responsive and relevant in society. Hence St. Joseph’s Orphanage opened its doors to include not only orphans, but also to boys and girls of all religions and ethnicity who came from very poor socio-economic and psychological backgrounds. St. Joseph’s Orphanage became St. Joseph’s Home.
We have 39 children (16 Boys and 23 Girls) whose ages range from 6 to 17 years, the Home is still true to its mission of seeing to the needs of poor children and helping them to get a good education and developing proper living skills so that they will become useful adults.
With its mission statement being the HOLISTIC DEVELOPMENT AND REINTEGRATION OF THE CHILDREN INTO SOCIETY, the pillars of the Home are: Formation, Education, Community Life.
Our services
The Home has established vocational skills training for those in the Home and outside the Home (those of poor social economic background) who are not academically inclined so that they can be independent in the future. They have also started a new programme on teaching/ learning methods to stimulate and motivate the children towards learning. This is done by activity-based learning, which is conducted in small groups of six children at the maximum.
To ensure that the children are not left out in the mainstream of society, regular outings are carried out. The children are sent to public schools and regular liaison is carried out with the schools. volunteers and tuition teachers help them cope with their formal schoolwork.
Our needs

Volunteers are also welcome as Care Givers. The range of responsibilities or assistance include:
The Home is dependent on donations for its services. The Welfare Department of Penang gives an annual grant to the Home. However, the grant is not enough to sustain the Home. The Home welcomes all of you to be partners with them in the development of these children. Hence every contribution, both in kind and cash as well as service is greatly appreciated.
Rebuilding of the Home’s dormitory, which was destroyed by fire, was funded entirely by generous donations from the Public and currently houses the girls’ dormitories. The Home requires basic foodstuff (fresh seafood and vegetables) and general cleaning supplies (household cleaners and detergents). A list of items can be viewed on the Home’s notice board.
The Home also runs a program where you can sponsor a child for RM1,000/- per annum. For more information on how you can help please contact the Home.
Our fundraising activities
Our average monthly expenditure is about RM40,000.00 and one of the biggest expenditure is electricity which costs around RM3120.16. In
 order to reduce electricity cost we have applied to SEDA (Sustainable Energy Development Authority (Malaysia) to sell Solar power to TNB to generate revenue for ourselves.Under this project we will have a sustainable yearly income of RM41,000.00 or RM3416.00 monthly over a
period of 21 years to produce 24kw of electricity. SEDA has already approved our application under application no. S2014070041 dated 8th
August, 2014.
 The cost of installing Solar Power is RM220,000.00 and we need to raise this sum soonest so as to fit into this years Solar Power program.

The Children’s Protection Society is a non-profit and non-governmental organisation, catering to the needs of neglected and abandoned children. It was officially launched in April 1992 by Puan Sri Chui Kah Peng.
Our objectives

The immediate objective of the Society is to provide the children at risk, a safe and homely environment. They focus on the emotional and physical development of each individual child, together with the enhancement of their educational, social and recreational skills. In the long term, they hope to develop alternative option for each child’s future.
The children in CPS come from broken homes, cases of abandoned orphans, some due to illness and poverty. At the moment there are eight boys, between the ages of four and 13 years. And 23 girls between the ages of five and 17 years.
The shelter is run by a team of five full-time and five part-time social workers. Volunteers also assist us in the form of tuition and recreational activities. The staff also undertakes home visits which is necessary to develop contact, and understanding, of the children’s original home background, and to provide them with the necessary support.
Many of their children have not been regular school-goers, and most of them are academically weak. With the assistance of the State Education Department, all the children have been re-admitted into schools.
Our services

Number of Paid Staff: 5
Our needs
The Children’s Protection Society (CPS) is very happy to get volunteer help – in fact, they need it! You can volunteer for many different types of tasks and input.
Learning and Tuition is always needed – many of the children have missed a substantial amount of school due to their backgrounds, and often find it difficult to catch up with school work.
Having volunteers give extra help in the Shelter is very, very valuable. If you are prepared for the extra challenges which many of the children face, and are prepared to commit a regular time a week (can be anything from an hour up), let us know.
If you also prepared to share another skill (computer, music, games), let us know. There may well be room to fit you in with a group of kids, possibly at the weekend.
Volunteers are also very welcome as chaperones and taxi drivers – their children are involved in a number of (different) external activities and they are always stretched with regard to transport. We also might need help at weekends in accompanying the children on outings.
CPS depends on grants and donations to cover their relatively high running costs. Hence, contributions, both in cash and kind, as well as services will be greatly appreciated.

Menjadikan ARP sebuah organisasi yang bergiat aktif membantu golongan yang memerlukan di peringkat lokal dan global.
Menjadikan ARP sebuah NGO yang terus komited memperjuangkan soal kebajikan dan aktiviti kemasyarakatan.
Mendapatkan kepercayaan seluruh ahli masyarakat, badan korporat, dan para penyumbang melalui pengurusan yang cekap, berintegriti, dan amanah.
Memasarkan jenama ARP sebagai sebuah NGO yang aktif bukan sahaja di Malaysia bahkan seantereo dunia melalui rangka strategi pemasaran yang berkesan.
Kunjungan seorang rakyat kemboja dalam tahun 2006 merupakan titik mula misi bantuan kemanusiaan ARP bergerak walaupun secara suka-suka tanpa organisasi berdaftar.
Kisah sedih kehidupan masyarakat Islam yang miskin di Kemboja yang hanya makan daging pada hari-hari kebesaran Islam sudah cukup memilukan dan memberi motivasi untuk menggerakkan misi bantuan pertama ke Kemboja.
Secara spontan 25 ekor lembu korban berjaya dikumpulkan dan dihantar ke beberapa perkampungan Islam berhampiran sempadan Vietnam kira-kira 8 jam perjalanan dari Phnom Penh melalui jalan darat. Sumbangan tersebut disambut dengan penuh kesyukuran dan kegembiraan oleh penduduk kampung yang jauh ketinggalan dalam serba serbi kehidupan.
Misi bantuan ini berterusan serta berkembang sebagai aktiviti kebajikan Kompleks Islam Al-I’tisam atau KIAI. Portfolio skop bantuan menjadi semakin meluas dengan pelancaran Misi Stand Up For Gaza, Misi Bantuan Penduduk Mangsa Krisis Lahad Datu, Bantuan Warga Miskin Anak Kariah dan sebagainya.
Melihat kepada perkembangan tersebut, satu keputusan penting telah dibuat untuk mendaftar ARP sebagai sebuah NGO bagi membolehkan aktiviti dijalankan dengan lebih tersusun, berkesan serta mempunyai akuntabiliti yang lebih baik kepada penyumbang dan juga kumpulan sasaran.
Oleh yang demikian tertubuhlah AL-I’TISAM RELIEF PROGRAM atau PROGRAM CERIA AL-I’TISAM yang selamat didaftarkan pada 8 April 2013 untuk memikul sebuah MISI;

Founded in 1998, TI-M is registered with the Registrar of Societies Malaysia as the Malaysian Society for Transparency and Integrity (ROS: 1649) and is the accredited National Chapter of the Berlin-based Transparency International.
Our vision is for a Nation that is Free of Corruption.
Transparency International Malaysia’s mission is to eradicate corruption and promote transparency, accountability and integrity throughout society.
We are committed to the following 5 values to guide our work:
•    Justice
•    Integrity
•    Transparency
•    Accountability
•    Courage
What We Do
Transparency International performs various research into measuring corruption across different companies globally. The three main Indexes are:
Corruption Perceptions Index
The Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI) is an annual index which measures the perceived levels of Public Sector Corruption in the different countries worldwide. It is a composite index of a combination of surveys and assessments of corruption collected by a variety of reputable institutions. The CPI is the most widely used indicator of corruption worldwide.
Bribe Payers Index
The Bribe Payers Index captures the supply side of international bribery, focusing on bribes paid by the private sector. As part of this index, TI asks business executives for their perceptions of the likelihood of companies from various countries, to engage in bribery.
Global Corruption Barometer
The Global Corruption Barometer is the largest world-wide public opinion survey on corruption. It addresses people’s direct experiences with bribery and details their views on corruption in the main institutions in their countries. It also provides insights into how willing and ready people are to stop corruption.
The Forest Governance and Integrity Programme (FGI) aims to reduce corruption and enhance integrity and accountability in the Forestry Sector. It advocates for the relevant agencies to curb corruption in the forestry sector and reduce illegal / unsustainable deforestation, and aims to strengthen and enhance forest governance systems in Malaysia.
Corruption is a great challenge and an obstacle to good business. Corruption adds to the cost of doing business, distorts competition and presents serious legal and reputation risks. In more recent times, the fight against corruption has gained momentum nationally and internationally, with many countries tightening or introducing new anti-bribery laws. Recognising the need to improve accountability, transparency and governance, Transparency International – Malaysia (TI-M) has established the Business Integrity Programme (BIP) unit to help businesses, governments and civil society achieve the goals.
The objectives of the TI-BIP is:
In 2013, TI BIP Malaysia Sdn Bhd (TI BIP) was formed to manage the growing work of the BIP Unit. Drawing on the experience of the TI global network, the TI BIP team uses the best in methodology and tools and adapts them to the setting and culture of Malaysian organisations. TI BIP is a wholly-owned subsidiary of TI Malaysia, with oversight provided by the TI Malaysia Executive Committee.
As part of Transparency International Malaysia’s (TI-M) effort to safeguard the integrity of political office, the Election Integrity Pledge website (http://www.timalaysia-electionpledge.org.my) was launched on 17 March 2012. The pledge is a voluntary, non-binding social contract for candidates standing for the next General Election to pledge to promote integrity, good governance, transparency and accountability, and to uphold the rule of law.
Compliance to the Pledge will not be monitored by TI-M but rather by the Rakyat. The website provides contact details of all signatories to allow interested citizens to contact these candidates. A feedback section is also available on the website to allow users to comment on the candidates’ adherence to the pledge.
The overall aim is to make elected representatives accountable in their public office by monitoring their conduct as elected lawmakers and adherence to the standards of the pledge as the war against corruption is the responsibility of all.
Political financing is a necessary element of a functioning democracy, allowing political parties to run smoothly. However, the financing of politics has to be transparent, properly accounted for, fully disclosed publicly and subject to effective government and social oversight. Failure to do so would result in serious monetisation of politics, leading to numerous problems, including corruption of the political process in the form more commonly known as “money politics”.
This project mainly focus on the financing of political activities, political parties, candidates and elections in Malaysia, both in past and present political landscapes. It aims to provide insights into the strengths and weaknesses of the electoral system in parliamentary and state elections as well as electoral campaigns within parties.
It is important to recognise that the monetisation of politics is a widespread phenomenon in Malaysia and that it contributes to the malaise of corruption. To address this challenge, it is imperative to undertake deep reforms of the political system, covering all aspects of national affairs that are relevant to political financing.
This project calls for, among other things, greater public disclosure in the financing of politics, autonomous and effective enforcement by regulatory regimes and a de-linking of politics from business in terms party ownership of corporate enterprises to create a level playing field in the Malaysian electoral competition.
Defence and security sector corruption is a scourge of development, democratisation and good governance. It wastes scarce resources and reduces public trust in the government, its armed forces and its security services.
The programme aims to reduce corruption risks in the defence and security sectors through the introduction of effective anti-corruption measures such as transparency in defence budgets, increased open bidding in defence procurement and greater accountability and transparency to the public and media awareness by the defence and security sectors.",admin@transparency.org.my,Transparency International – Malaysian Chapter,http://transparency.org.my/,,

GPM has extended various assistance to communities in more than 20 countries such as Afghanistan, Albania,  Bosnia Herzegovina, Cambodia, Chechnya, Indonesia, Iraq, Laos, Kashmir, Kosovo, Lebanon, Myanmar, Pakistan, Palestine, Philippines, Sri Lanka, Sudan, Thailand,  Timor Leste, and  Uzbekistan.
Over the years, GPM slowly evolves to become an international relief and development organisation  working to alleviate human suffering among the world’s poorest and most needy communities, regardless of race, creed, gender, nationality or political inclination. Although the main focus of GPM is at the international level, it also realises that quite a number of local communities are in need of some kind of assistance. Thus GPM also carries out a few local programs such as a community development project in Sarikei Division, Sarawak.
Through generous donation from the public, GPM has been able to provide help to thousands of people in many communities around the world. Besides maintaining our own offices, GPM also works in partnership with local community-based organisations. The latter approach is not  only cost-effective, but also instrumental in building the capacity of local people to help themselves.
GPM is a founding member of  Union of NGOs of the Islamic World (UNIW) based in Istanbul, Turkey. In 2006, GPM was appointed to head the Social, Humanitarian and Solidarity Commission of  UNIW. Additionally, as a recognition  of its role in humanitarian work, the Secretary General of the Organisation of Islamic Conference admits GPM as  a member of  OIC Humanitarian Forum (OICHF).

It promotes a better understanding of Human Settlements and encourages excellence in planning, Development and management to improve the quality of life and sustainability of human settlements.
Historical Background
The Eastern Regional Organisation for Planning and Housing (EAROPH) was founded at its first Congress help in New Delhi, India in 1956, at a time when emerging nations of the third world were beginning to realise the importance of their socio/cultural identities and traditional values. Rapid pace of development, particularly in Asia, stimulated debates on many issues -not least of these were the subjects of urban planning and housing for the masses. Concerned professionals of various disciplines concurred that these were matters which would be best handled by those who were culturally in-tune with the countries involved -an ideal upon which EAROPH’ s foundation was laid.
EAROPH was officially inaugurated under its new constitution at the second EAROPH International Congress in Tokyo, Japan in 1960 and gained its NGO status from the United Nations (UN) through its then parent organisation, the International Federal of Housing and Planning (IFHP).
The EAROPH region covers all countries in Asia, Australasia and the Pacific region. The EAROPH Secretariat was moved from New Delhi, India to Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia in 1978.
What are our Objectives?
EAROPH aims to consolidate and continually promote the provision of better quality of life, housing and planning in the Asian, Australasia and Pacific region. The EAROPH region has been acknowledged as the most dynamic in the world in terms of economic growth, magnitude of urbanisation, population size and ethnic diversity.
EAROPH initial direction was to stay abreast of all human settlement issues and problems that result from rapid development of a nation. Since the 13th EAROPH World Planning Congress in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia in 1992, the programme of activities has been expended to cover areas similar to those of the Agenda 21 as adopted by the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED) at Rio de Janeiro in June 1992. Thus, over and above the issues on Housing and Planning, EAROPH will concentrate on the promotion of a holistic approach to human settlements incorporating the following:
Environmental and energy issues;
With the launching of the Langkawi Strategic Plan in 1996, EAROPH’ has redefined its role and goals. These are:

Three years after its inception on January 2nd 2000, the AEC was transformed into a full-fledged academic institution and was renamed the Asia-Europe Institute (AEI) and is hosted by the University of Malaya, the oldest university in Malaysia.
Over the years, AEI has received staunch support from the government of Malaysia, working in partnership with other ASEM countries. It reflects Malaysia’s commitment to internationalising higher education and advancing the idea of AEI as an ‘educational infrastructure and knowledge of network for Asia and Europe in the 21st century’.
AEI aims to be a place where intellectual discourses are held. Key issues on intensifying globalisation and regionalisation, the environment, international business, innovation and technologies and inter-regional relations between Asia and Europe are discussed. AEI also promotes collaborative research with academicians as well as the government and institutions from the private sector. Our research pillars and range of international postgraduate courses indicate the breadth and quality of expertise that AEI can bring to bear. As such, our postgraduate students are central to the realisation of a collaborative and innovative education hub for the future.

We thank God for HIS strength to us as we are in HIS ministry through PPKT. At the end of 1998, Rev Ivan Chew, Pastor of Christ City Church, invited Stephen Chow from Penang to come over to Taiping to start a social concerns work. As of January 1999 Stephen was employed by Christ City Church to start this work. On 1 February 2002, we decided to form a society and we were registered with the Registrar of Societies (ROS) as Persatuan Perkhidmatan Komuniti Taiping (PPKT). Since that time we are not under Christ City Church anymore but are an inter-denominational Christian organization. On 19 July 2002, our organization was officially launched by YB En. Rafek Bin Reshidullah, Director of Social Welfare Department of Perak. From March 2003 until now, Mr. Sung Lai Su has been our chairman. Although the first five years was very hard for us to carry on in the ministry but by grace of God we managed to pull through.
The first 3 social services we established were: Day Center for Mental Health, Home of Mercy and a Disabled People’s Fellowship. Mercy Home was a home for ladies who had mental health problems. Ms. Kuan Gek Kuan was our first dedicated volunteer. She served as a full-time volunteer in the home itself. Unfortunately, at the end of 1999, the home had to close down due to financial constraints. The early work in ESDA was very difficult and development was slow due to lack of funds. But from May 1st 2006, we started to raise funds through the Charity Fair. In late 2000, Rev. Kanapathy joined us as a full-time volunteer in the services for the poor. In 2001 the work for disabled people extended to another programme – Handicamp. This is a camp for disabled persons. We were invited to our first Handicamp by Rumah Kesayangan, Bukit Mertajam. The Handicamp program was introduced by Malaysian Care, KL. Also in 2001, we started a sheltered workshop for disabled people. Since 2004, the workshop has been renamed “Work Centre for Disabled People”.

The Rector of St. Francis Xavier Church had offered the use of a vacant house in the compound and so Anne moved in with five Special Children and two helpers. It was a difficult start as the initial sum of RM6,500.00 donated by the previous Rector, Fr. Win van der Salm was depleting fast and expenses began adding up. Anne and the helpers had to do everything; give care, love, education and therapy to the children, marketing, cooking, housekeeping, plus meeting with families who have Special Children. It was however an exhilarating period to kick off such a project. There were individuals who cast doubts on the effort saying that such rehabilitation project belong to the Government, among others.Nevertheless, Bukit Harapan persevered doggedly.
The stay in the first Home lasted about a year and owing to various factors, Bukit Harapan moved to Kota Kinabalu, to a rented house six miles away in Putatan. More Special Persons were taken in and a few more helpers and Bukit Harapan became better known to the community at large, with timely exposures to the public in the media. The stay in this second house was also brief and about a year later, Bukit Harapan shifted to Jalan Saga, Likas, Kota Kinabalu where it remained for more than 15 years.
Bukit Harapan began making greater strides in its rehabilitation activities while also serving as shelter to abused women and children as well as victims of rape. Bukit Harapan began to stand out as a publicly-funded Home which cares for the underprivileged and helpless community. Some Special Persons were also referred by the Welfare Department. Soon the Home became crowded. A temporary “classroom” was donated by the Canadian High Commission to meet the growing number of residents. Rooms were added on the ground floor and the kitchen and common living room on the ground floor was enlarged. Soon the Home took over an adjacent land in Jalan Saga where on August 31st, 1994, a new “office/school complex” called Aokam Therapeutic Centre in gratitude to the company was built.",,Bukit Harapan,http://www.bukitharapan.blogspot.com/,,

1962,"No. 35, 1/14, Bandar Country Home, Rawang",Support Groups,+6012 2663 649,Masliza Abu Bakar ,"Kematian ibu atau bapa akan menyebabkan anak-anak merasa kekosongan dalam diri mereka. Hilangnya belaian kasih sayang dari orang tua serta tempat untuk berlindung menjadikan anak-anak ini dihantui perasaan sedih.Selain kehilangan kasih sayang, keperluan hidup mereka juga tidak lagi seperti sebelumnya. Makan, minum, pakaian dan lain-lain juga turut berubah seiring dengan pemergian yang tersayang.
Realiti kehidupan masyarakat hari ini enunjukkan bahawa kebanyakan anak yatim yang tidak mendapat perhatian sewajarnya akan mengharungi kehidupan yang begitu sukar, perit dan menyedihkan.
Umum mengetahui bahawa Islam adalah satu agama yang menitikberatkan soal kasih sayang. Ia menekankan kepada kita agar tidak menyisihkan dan mengabaikan anak yatim terutama yang datang dari keluarga yang serba kekurangan dan tidak berkemampuan.
Anak-anak ini juga memerlukan belaian dan kasih sayang serta keperluan hidup seperti makan, minum dan pakaian seperti manusia yang lain. Ini supaya mereka dapat menjalani kehidupan yang mendatang dengan harmoni dan bahagia.
“Sebagai seorang Muslim, rasa tanggungjawab itu perlu ada lebih-lebih lagi bagi menjaga golongan-golongan seperti mereka ini,” ujar pengasas Rumah Amal Baitul Fitrah, Masliza Abu Bakar, 38.
Menurutnya, anak yatim juga memerlukan pembelaan yang sewajarnya supaya pelajaran dan kehidupan mereka tidak terabai disebabkan kekurangan dari segi wang dan lain-lain untuk menampung kehidupan mereka.
Rumah Amal Baitul Fitrah memulakan operasinya pada tahun 2006 dengan permulaan penghuninya seramai 16 orang dan hanya menyewa rumah flat untuk anak-anak ini berteduh ketika itu.
Kini, Rumah Amal Baitul Fitrah telah berpindah ke rumah teres semi-D di No. 3 Jalan Desa 2/1, Bandar Country Home, Rawang. Rumah ini menempatkan seramai 30 anak-anak yatim selain menjaga kebajikan 20 ibu tunggal.
Masliza berkata, rumah itu menempatkan anak-anak yatim perempuan, manakala yang lelaki masih tinggal di rumah flat yang lama.
“Apabila ada majlis keraian seperti Maulidur Rasul, anak-anak yatim dan ibu-ibu tunggal ini akan berkumpul di sini,” katanya yang mesra dengan panggilan Ummu Liza di kalangan penghuni Baitul Fitrah dan rakan-rakan.
Kata beliau, rumah ini tidak mengamalkan disiplin yang ketat kerana pengasasnya mahukan suasana kekeluargaan di dalamnya.
“Setiap anak-anak ini kita didik dan berikan kasih sayang seperti seorang ibu kepada anak-anaknya. Kita tidak mahu mereka terasa tersisih dengan kekurangan yang dimiliki.
“Apabila ada kesempatan, kita akan membawa anak-anak ini bercuti selain menghantar mereka ke kem-kem motivasi supaya pelajaran mereka tidak terabai,” katanya.
Menurut Ummu Liza lagi, anak-anak yatim ini menunjukkan prestasi pelajaran yang boleh dibanggakan berbanding sebelumnya.
“Di sini, mereka akan diberikan tuisyen oleh guru-guru yang secara sukarela mengajar mereka. Kita adakan tuisyen seperti matematik dan bahasa Inggeris untuk anak-anak yang akan menduduki peperiksaan,” jelasnya.
Melihat persekitaran rumah yang didiami oleh anak-anak ini, sebak mula menyelubungi diri. Di ruang bawah rumah ini terdapat sofa, televisyen dan meja makan hasil sumbangan orang ramai. Ruang yang kecil itu juga turut menempatkan barang-barang sumbangan seperti pakaian dan tilam selain kerusi untuk mereka belajar. Almari yang ada juga tidak dapat digunakan sepenuhnya kerana terlalu uzur.
Kata Ummu Liza, rumah teres ini memiliki empat buah bilik dan setiap bilik dilengkapi dengan katil dua tingkat. Untuk bilik utamanya, diletakkan seramai tujuh orang di dalamnya.
“Rumah ini walaupun dua tingkat tetapi ia masih belum dapat menampung mereka ini. Sebab itu, kita cari rumah lain untuk menempatkan anak-anak kecil supaya tidak mengganggu yang dewasa untuk belajar,” ujarnya.
Selain itu, rumah amal ini juga hanya memiliki sebuah van lama yang digunakan untuk menghantar dan mengambil anak-anak ini dari sekolah.
Menurut Ummu Liza, dia terpaksa menjadi pemandu sementara untuk anak-anak ini kerana ketika ini mereka tidak mempunyai pemandu.
“Pemandu yang lama terpaksa berhenti kerana tidak sihat dan kita dalam proses mendapatkan pemandu yang baru bagi memudahkan segala urusan.
“Dengan berbekalkan sebuah van lama ini, kami membawa anak-anak ini untuk pergi bercuti. Terpaksalah kami berulang-alik mengangkut mereka kerana tidak mempunyai kenderaan yang cukup. Kadang-kadang, ada juga guru-guru tuisyen ini menggunakan kenderaan mereka,” katanya.
Tambahnya lagi, setiap sumbangan bukan sahaja digunakan oleh mereka namun ia turut diagihkan kepada anak-anak yatim dan ibu-ibu tunggal yang lain.",,RUMAH ANAK YATIM BAITUL FITRAH,http://rumahanakyatimbaitulfitrah.blogspot.com/,,

Bermula dengan tiga orang murid, Ustaz Hashim memberi bimbingan kelas agama dan al-Quran kepada mereka. Situasi sekarang yang tidak membenarkan anak-anak pelarian Rohingya dan Myanmar Muslim ini mendapat pendidikan formal di sekolah tempatan, membuatkan jumlah anak murid Ustaz Hashim bertambah dari tahun ke tahun. Dan kini pada tahun 2010, jumlah anak muridnya mencapai hampir 130 orang di mana hampir kesemuanya merupakan anak-anak yatim atau anak-anak fakir miskin. Hampir 40 orang anak muridnya tinggal di asrama Madrasah Hashimiah dan selebihnya tinggal bersama ibu bapa atau waris saudara mara. Alhamdulillah, sekian tahun berkembang, kini Madrasah Hashimiah juga menyediakan kelas akademik asas seperti Matematik, Bahasa Melayu, Bahasa Inggeris dan Bahasa Myanmar di samping kelas agama seperti Fardhu Ain, Iqra dan Tahfiz Quran.
Madrasah Hashimiah ini tidak mendapat sebarang bantuan kewangan tetap dari mana-mana pihak kerana status sekolahnya sebagai sekolah pelarian. Ustaz Hashim selaku pengetua Madrasah Hashimiah bertanggungjawab untuk mendapatkan dana bagi menampung perbelanjaan sekolah yang mencapai RM7000 sebulan. Penat lelah Ustaz Hashim yang membuat kelas Quran dengan kaedah ‘Home Tuition’ sedikit sebanyak telah digunakan untuk perbelanjaan Madrasah Hashimiah.
Ustaz Hashim amat mengalukan orang ramai untuk datang memberi sumbangan atau bantuan kepada anak-anak yatim dan miskin Madrasah Hashimiah ini. Berkat sumbangan orang ramai, sentiasa akan didoakannya agar memperoleh kebaikan di dunia dan akhirat, insyaAllah.",,Rumah Anak Yatim Rohingya,,,

On May 24th, 1991, Mr. And Mrs. Ch’ng Joo Beng extended the spirit of Taiwan Eden to Malaysia and set up the Eden Handicap Service Center in Penang.
Transforming a caring heart into a channel of blessing, Taiwan Eden officially established the Double Blessing (Shuang Fu) International Dispatch Center in the year 2000. In cooperation with the internationalization of Taiwan Eden’s ministry, the ministry of Kuala Lumpur has also been renamed “Double Blessing”.
About Shuang Fu:
The ultimate aim of setting up the Shuang Fu (Double Blessing) is to complement the effort of the Government to enrich the lives of the disabled through training and building up their self confidence.
It was fonded by Madam Shen Chiu Hsiang, who is a disabled person herself and her husband Rev. Ch’ng Joo Beng. With their years of experience at the Eden Handicap Service Centre, Penang, where they were involved in promoting the well-being for the disabled, Shuang Fu was set up and commenced to operate in October 2000.It was officially declared open by Datuk Seri Dr. Fong Chan Onn, the Minister of Human Resources Ministry, Malaysia on 19th August 2001. Shuang Fu is a charitable organisation registered with the registrar of Society under the Societies’ Act 1966.
Our Aims:-
Shuang Fu aims to help disabled persons and former drug addicts to achieve a breakthrough in their lives by teaching them suitable vocational skills to enable them to have better job opportunities. With self-sufficiency and self-confidence they would hopefully be reintegrated into society.
To achieve optimum results, Shuang Fu has provided services such as vocational training including handicraft, recycling, computer skills, job placement, and counseling without any charge to the disabled and underprivileged. The Shuang fu programs are open to all, regardless of race or religion.",info@shuangfu.org,Shuang Fu (Double Blessing) Disabled Independent Living Association,http://www.shuangfu.org,,

Hasil dari mesyuarat tersebut satu Deraf Perlembagaan telah digubal dan kemudiannya telah disahkan oleh Majlis Kebajikan Masyarakat masing-masing.
Penubuhan Majlis Kebajikan Masyarakat Kebangsaan Malaysia (MKMKM) pada mulanya telah ditetapkan pada bulan Ogos 1965 akan tetapi disebabkan perpisahan Singapura dari Malaysia, penubuhannya telah ditangguhkan. Selepas pindaan dibuat di dalam Deraf Perlembagaan dengan mengeluarkan perkara ‘Singapura’, MKMKM telah dilancarkan dengan rasminya pada 3hb Februari 1966 dengan YB Menteri Kebajikan Masyarakat sebagai Yang Di Pertua. Sejak dari itu, Menteri yang bertanggungjawab bagi kebajikan masyarakat telah memimpin Majlis ini sebagai Yang Di Pertua.
Pada bulan Ogos 1998 Majlis Kebajikan Masyarakat Kebangsaan ini kemudiannya telah ditukar nama sebagai Majlis Kebajikan dan Pembangunan Masyarakat Kebangsaan Malaysia (MAKPEM) atau “National Council of Welfare and Social Development Malaysia (NCWSDM)” untuk memperluaskan lagi peranan dan keahliannya.",makpem@gmail.com /  ncswm@po.jaring.my ,Majlis Kebajikan Dan  Pembangunan Masyarakat  Kebangsaan Malaysia  (MAKPEM),,,

2042,"No.3-24 Jalan PM 9,  Plaza Mahkota,  75000 Melaka,  Malaysia",Support Groups, 019  6559884,,"It is not known when actually the sport of bicycle racing was introduced in Malaysia. From reliable sources it is believed that bicycle racing was introduced by British Soldiers posted to Malaya before 1938. It was only in 1938 that organised activities in the sport of bicycle racing began with a number of Road races being held in and around Kuala Lumpur.
The first State in Malaysia to form an Association was Selangor in 1938 with a number of Bicycle Racing Clubs already in existence then such as the ” Rough Riders ” “Agas Wheelers” and others. With the formation of the Selangor State Cycling Association, cycling activities started to spread to other States like Perak, Melaka and Penang.
The Malaysian National Cycling Federation was formed in 1953 thanks to the untiring efforts of the late Mr. Gurchan Singh and Captain C.O. Jennings (an officer of the New Zealand Regiment) with the States of Selangor, Melaka, Perak and Penang being affiliated members. The Registration Number of the Federation was RSM 146/55.
Major Road Races such as the Kuala Lumpur to Ipoh Race had been held since 1947 and the response from the Affiliates and all concerned had been tremendous. This went on until the end of 1970 when it was replaced by the Kuala Lumpur to Alor Star Race. Apart from this, other road races and track events were held from time to time.
It needs to be stated here that track events had already been introduced in the 1950s in Venues like the Lucky World Park in Kuala Lumpur where events were run on ” Plank Track ” and on grass in Melaka. Other events competed on grass were in Kuala Lumpur, Klang, Melaka, Ipoh, Penang, Muar and Segamat.
The Malaysian National Cycling Federation organised an International Road Race and Grass Track Events in conjunction with the Independence celebrations of Malaysia in 1957 – all in all, eleven Countries took part in the Competition.
In 1957 when Thailand hosted the 1st SEAP Games ( now know as the SEA Games ) the National Cycling Team, though very prepared and can be considered as strong contenders, was unable to take part because the National Cycling body had not been accepted as an affiliate of the Union Cycliste Internationale, thus preventing it from competing.
On 5th. March, 1960, the Malaysian National Cycling Federation was accepted as a member of the Union Cycliste Internationale and at the same time became a member of the Olympic Council of Malaysia. With this new status, the MNCF was invited by Indonesia to participate in their Competition and without hesitation sent a team there.
In August 1962, MNCF took part in the IV Asian Games in Jakarta, Indonesia where we managed to finish third for a Bronze Medal in the Team Road Race.
During the IV Asian Games in Jakarta in August, 1962, the late Mr. Gurchan Singh initiated the formation of the Asian Cycling Federation comprising of Indonesia, Japan, Philippines, Taiwan, Iran, Hong Kong, Thailand and Malaya ( now Malaysia ) with him being elected as the President.
In October, 1962, the National Cycling Team once again competed in an International Meet. This time in the Commonwealth Games held in Perth, Australia, where for the first time, the Team competed in the Track Events in a real Velodrome.
On his return from Perth, the late Mr. Gurchan Singh started the ball rolling for the construction of a proper Velodrome in Malaysia but his efforts came to an abrupt end with his unexpected demise on 5th. March, 1965.
When Malaysia was formed in the year 1963, MNCF were given the honours to host the 1st. Asian Cycling Championships in Kuala Lumpur. Nine Countries took part in the Championships i.e. Philippines, Thailand, Vietnam, Singapore, Iran, Indonesia, Japan, Hong Kong and the hosts Malaysia. The Malaysian team managed to win a gold medal in the Team grass track event at the Merdeka Stadium.
In preparation for the Olympic Games in Tokyo in 1964, MNCF for the first time, organised the Tour of Malaysia which started in Alor Star, Kedah and ended in Singapore. A number of Countries took part in the Tour.
And again for the first time, Malaysia took part in the Olympic Games in Tokyo in October, 1964. Even though we did not win any medals, the exposure and experience the Team gained from the Olympic Games were considerable.
In October, 1965, the Malaysian Team took part in the 2nd Asian Cycling Championships held in Manila, Philippines where the Team managed to win a number of Bronze medals only.
In December of the same year, Malaysia hosted the 3rd SEAP Games in Kuala Lumpur. Seven Countries took part and Malaysia managed to win one gold, six silver and one Bronze medals.
From the year 1966 to 1969, the Malaysian Team, took part in a number of International Competitions such as the Asian Games, the SEA Games and also the Olympic Games but the most memorable event was the ” Goodwill Race ” from Kuala Lumpur to Singapore with the Riders carrying a Goodwill message from the Rt. Hon. YTM Tunku Abdul Rahman Putra, Prime Minister of Malaysia to the Rt. Hon. Mr. Lee Kuan Yew, Prime Minister of Singapore.
Due to the failure of the National Team in the 1969 SEAP Games in Rangoon Burma, the Olympic Council of Malaysia decided to drop Cycling from the SEA Games to be hosted by Malaysia in Kuala Lumpur in 1971. This failure also saw the resignation of the whole EXCO during the Annual General Meeting of the MNCF in January, 1970.
A new Committee without a President was formed to take over the administration of the MNCF immediately after the Annual General Meeting and it inherited a total of $44.60 being the balance in the Bank. But with dedication and personal sacrifices by the New Committee Members, they were able to face all the challenges including the damaging decision of the Olympic Council of Malaysia not to include Cycling in the 1971 SEA Games in Kuala Lumpur.
With this kind of determination and dedication by the Committee Members and all those involved, all the hard work put in by them finally paid off, when in August 1970 the National Team won the SUHARTO Cup in the Tour of Jawa in which more than a dozen teams from inside and outside Indonesia took part.
This win in Indonesia was greeted by ridicule by most of the news media in Malaysia saying that it was only a flash in the pan. But when in December, 1970, the National Team when competing in the Asian Games in Bangkok, won 2 Gold, 1 Silver and 2 Bronze Medals, only then the press started to took at MNCF in a different light and with renewed respect.
And now with the Press behind as, we were able to convince the Olympic Council of Malaysia to reinstate Cycling in the 1971 SEA Games in Kuala Lumpur. With the reinstatement of Cycling, the Malaysian Team once again proved the we were a team to be proud of when we won 5 Gold, 3 Sliver and 2 Bronze Medals.
In order to improve and further develop Cycling in Malaysia, MNCF revived the Tour of Malaysia which was last organised in 1963. This event was competed for by four of our neighbours i.e. Brunei, Singapore, Thailand and Indonesia.
In August, 1972, the National Team took part in the Munich Olympic Games. The Team did not win any medal here but the exposure and the experience gained from it, proved to be very valuable when we succeeded greatly in the SEA Games 1973 in Singapore.
In 1973 and 1975, we organised the Tour of Malaysia and these times around, Countries from the West, Middle East and the Far East took part.
During this period, MNCF organised a number of Courses and Seminars for our Local Coaches and Technical Officials. International Coaches and Technical Officials such as Mr. Oscar Plattner, Mr. Gustar Killian, Mr. Ib Van Mansen and others were invited to conduct these Courses and Seminars. Most of our local Coaches and Technical Officials benefited greatly from these Courses and Seminars.
Between the period 1966 and 1979, a member of State Cycling Associations were formed. They included the States of Kedah, Johore, Negeri Sembilan, Pahang, Perlis, Terengganu, Sarawak, Kelantan and Wilayah Persekutuan Kuala Lumpur. Recently a new association was born i.e. the Labuan Cycling Association. The State of Sabah was in the process of forming an association then.
Once again in 1974, Malaysia hosted the 9th Asian Cycling Championships. The Road Events were held in Shah Alam while the Track Events were held in the Merdeka Stadium, Kuala Lumpur. The Malaysian Team managed to win 2 gold medals in this Championships in which 16 Countries took part.
In the Eighties saw the birth of 2 Velodromes, one in Ipoh City and the other in the Federal Capital of Kuala Lumpur. All these were due to the cries of the officials, riders and the supporters for a Velodrome as early as the Sixties. And now instead of one, we have 2 Velodromes which can be considered if not the best in the world, at least the best in this Region and which we hope will be fully utilised and not be regarded as ” White Elephants “.
We only had 4 affiliates in the Sixties but now the number has increased to 15 with the latest being the Labuan Cycling Association. We are in the process of assisting Sabah represented to form an Association and once this is achieved, the whole Country will have been represented in the MNCF.
Presently a number of Riders have been sent overseas to Europe and Australia for exposure and to undergo Scientific training. They were also equipped with the latest Modern Equipments with the assistance of well wishers. We hope that all those fortunate Riders will in return, render their services to the MNCF for the further development of the Sport of Cycling in Malaysia, when the time comes for them to retire from active cycling.",,Malaysian National Cycling Federation,http://www.mncf.org.my,,

On Tuesday, 11th July, 1961, Y.T.M. Tunku Abdul Rahman Putra Al-Haj, then Prime Minister of the Federation of Malaya, accepted an invitation from the President and members of Rotary Club of Kuala Lumpur to address a special meeting of the club.
During his speech, the Tunku spoke of Malaya’s firm support for the Commonwealth and said that he would very much like to see a Branch of the Royal Commonwealth Society formed in Kuala Lumpur.
YTM Tunku Abdul Rahman, addressing the Special Rotary Meeting at which he proposed the formation of a Branch of the Royal Commonwealth Society. Among those present were Rtn Gurbaksh Singh Sambhi, HE Mr. T. Critchley High Commissioner for Australia, Rtn President V.M. Hutson, Puan Sharifah Rodziah and Tuan Haji Mustapha Albakri. The date was 11th July, 1961.
The President of the Rotary Club, Encik V.M. Hutson, made the formation of a Branch of the Society one of the major projects for the Club in that Rotary year.
A Foundation Committee of the Rotarians was formed, headed by Encik Hutson to process the ground work necessary to form the Branch. The committee was comprised of the following persons who became the Founder Members of the Branch:-
Preparatory work was completed and the inaugural meeting was held on 24th May, 1962 with the President of the Senate, the late Y.B. Dato Haji Abdul Rahman b. Mohd Yasin in the Chair.
At the meeting, the following resolution was adopted:-
“This meeting of the Fellows of the Royal Commonwealth Society and of Commonwealth Citizens resident in the Federation of Malaya resolves that a Federation of Malaya Branch of the Royal Commonwealth Society be and the same is hereby formed.”
The inaugural meeting held at the Dewan Tunku Abdul Rahman which was chaired by YB Dato Haji Rahman bin Mohd Yasin was elected Founder President of the Branch, with him is Mr. V.M. Hutson who was elected Founder Chairman of the Branch.
The constitution was drafted, sent to London for approval at Head-Quarters and the first General Meeting was held on 31st October, 1962 when it was adopted by the Branch. At that meeting, the late Y.B. Dato Haji Abdul Rahman b. Mohd Yasin was elected the first President of the Branch and Encik V.M. Hutson was elected as Chairman of the Council.
The Branch then had 89 fellows. Today the membership records stand at 3583 Fellows and our Branch has been given credit for being the fastest growing branch in the Commonwealth.
On 14th December, 1962, Mr. David Daniels, the former Secretary General of the Society, visited the Branch and at a reception arranged by our first Prime Minister, Y.T.M. Tunku Abdul Rahman Putra Al –Haj, The President the late Y.B. Dato Haji Abdul Rahman announced that our Prime Minister had agreed to be the Patron of the branch and to accept election as the first honorary Fellow. During the reception, a telegram was received from London Headquarters with the news that our Prime Minister had been appointed Honorary Life Vice-President of the Society, the highest honour the society can award.
Since those early days the Society has grown in strength and popularity. A number of exhibitions depicting various aspects of the Commonwealth have been organized, festivals of Commonwealth firms have been arranged and a number of eminent speakers on subject concerning the Commonwealth have been welcomed by our Fellows. Each year up to 1970, an annual dinner to commemorate Commonwealth Day was organized, until the celebration of Commonwealth Day was discontinued by mutual agreement at a Prime Ministers’ Conference. During the next the next three years, Muhibbah parties were held at the home of the Chairman, Encik V.M. Hutson in December, Commonwealth Day celebration was resumed in 1977. The Branch has concerned itself also with the young people and Essay Competitions have been held, the winner being awarded a handsome Challenge Trophy which was donated by well wishers. Inter-school debates have been organized to encourage interest in the Commonwealth amongst young people.
Early in 1965, as a result of a suggestion by the then Honorary Secretary, Encik A. Y. L. Lee, it was decided to organize Charter Flights to the United Kingdom to give Malaysian Fellows an opportunity to travel to parts of the world, which by normal means of transport might be beyond their financial resources. The Charter flight idea was an immediate success. Not only did our membership start to increase rapidly but as a result of generous donations by the airline supplying the charter aircraft, our funds started to grow.
From 1964, a member of the Council, Encik Sarjeet Singh Dhaliwall, became a strong advocate for the erection of a building in the name of the society in Kuala Lumpur. But while his proposal had the support and enthusiasm of the other members of the Council, lack of funds ruled out any plans towards this objective. The introduction of Charter Flights changed all this and the prospects for a Headquarters Building began to look not just bright but actually rosy. By early 1969 the council was looking for suitable land.
Commenwealth House
The fine half acre site on which our building stands was acquired with the assistance of Dato’ T.K. Wen and the building has been designed by one of Malaysia’s most outstanding architects, Dato Kington Loo at no cost to the Branch.
The foundation stone was laid by Y.A.B Allayyarham Tun Haji Abdul Razak Bin Dato Hussain then Deputy Prime Minister of Malaysia on Friday, 6th March 1970.
Not far from the town centre of Kuala Lumpur’s latest suburb, Damansara Heights, “Commonwealth House” with its Minangkabau style roof has a prominent position. The building was designed by Dato Kington Loo who availed his services. The first phrase of the building consisted of an entrance area and large lounge, a library-cum-committee room, and office on the ground floor. A broad staircase leads to the first floor which consists of a large lecture hall to accommodate some 400 people. The building contains also, residential accommodation consisting of four double air-conditioned bedrooms with attached bathrooms.
In order to furnish these magnificent premises, an appeal was addressed to all the Commonwealth High Commissions in Kuala Lumpur and we record with thanks the response from the U.K. High Commission who agreed to furnish the main lounge ( now known as the U.K. Lounge), the Singapore High Commission who agreed to furnish a bedroom (now know as the Singapore Suite. We also record our thanks to I.C.I. Malaysia Sdn. Bhd and Sun Furniture Sdn. Bhd., both these firms generously furnished two other bedrooms. London Headquarters and the New Zealand High Commission donated paintings.
During the year 1970, the name of the Branch was changed from the “States of Malaya Branch” to the “Malaysian Branch” and as the year drew to a close on 15th December, an Extraordinary General Meeting was held when it was unanimously decided to give the Branch autonomous status.
Then on Wednesday, 17 February1971, commonwealth house was declared open officially at a colourful ceremony by our Patron, Y.T.M. Tunku Abdul Rahman Putra Al-Haj.
In 1972, Y.A.B. Tun Sir Henry H.S. Lee who was President of the Branch for 5 years and has been Fellow of the Society since 1921, was appointed a Vice-Patron of the Branch in recognition of his immense service to the Branch.
A highlight in the history of the Branch came in March, 1972 when H.M. Queen Elizabeth II visited Commonwealth House accompanied by HRH Prince Philip and HRH Princess Anne. The Royal visitors were shown over the newly completed building and spent nearly an hour meeting the council and hundred of members who had gathered to meet them.
The second phase implemented in 1972/73 involved the construction of a swimming pool and changing rooms. For this purpose, an additional 8,000 square feet of land was purchased. The pool and dressing rooms were designed by Dato Lau Foo Sun who donated his services and also supervised the construction. The filteration plant for the pool was generously donated by Encik Brig L.G. Young, a founder Council Member. Also in the second phase the main lecture hall was air-conditioned and fitted up for the projection of films. Now available also is a Sony 40 inch wide screen video projector. Disco equipment has also been installed.
The Branch was honoured with a visit by HRH The Sultan of Selangor and HRH Tengku Ampuan of Selangor. During this visit, HRH presented the Branch with a magnificent grandfather clock which stands at the south end of the U.K. Lounge.
In March, 1976, the lecture hall was named “ Balai Tunku Abdul Rahman” in honour of the Patron who on that occasion presented the Branch with a bronze bust of himself which graces the front entrance of Commonwealth House.
Further development took place in 1975/76 when a large new office was constructed in addition to a machine room and four fruit machines are now in use. Still further expansion took place in 1981/82 with the addition of an air-conditioned dining room and the Tudor Bar.
With 800 active Fellows as Members of which 80% together with their families are resident in Kuala Lumpur and its suburbs, Commonwealth House has become one of the most popular clubs in the Federal Capital.
It is particularly popular as a club for visitors from Commonwealth countries who come to Malaysia to work on short term contracts. Malaysian Fellows are delighted to offer the hospitality of their Branch to these visitors who have a chance of meeting a cross-section of Malaysians from many walks of life.
Annual highlights are the celebration of Commonwealth Day. This event results in the highest attendance for any function during the year. Other social functions are mainly held to celebrate the festive season of the different races.
Facilities are available for indoor games such as Darts, Table Tennis and Billiards. Film Shows and Video Shows on a large screen are regular features on our entertainment programme. Talks by eminent speakers are arranged from time to time. There are four slot machines, playing of which is restricted to Members only.
In 1981 after five years as President, Y.B. Tan Sri Abdul Jamil Bin Abdul Rais was appointed a Vice Patron of the Branch in recognition of his immense services to the Branch. On 1st March 1982, the Branch celebrated its 21st Birthday, when our Patron YTM Abdul Rahman Putra Al Haj attended a special dinner and declared open two new extensions, namely the Tudor Bar and the small dining room both of which are fully air conditioned. The main verandah of the UK Lounge was extended to double its original size.
The year 1984 saw the complete renovation of the Swimming Pool area, while in 1985 the kitchen and Staff Quarters were enlarged and renovated. The Tudor Bar was enlarged, necessitating the construction of a new conference room and as a result of popular demand a Squash Court was built.
With these extensions and additions the three quarter acre site of our Branch headquarters has been fully utilized.
The Branch throughout its 24 year history has enjoyed the firm support and encouragement of the Government of Malaysia and the High Commissioners and officials of all Commonwealth missions in this country and we place on record our most grateful thanks to them all.
Our Malaysian Branch is justly proud that it is the only branch in the Commonwealth, apart from London Headquarters, which own its own premises providing full club facilities and residential accommodation. We look forward to the future with confidence.", communications.rcs@gmail.com ,Royal Commonwealth Society Malaysia,,,
2112,,Support Groups,,,"Who are we
SOS Selangor is a coalition of NGOs and individuals who are concerned about the social, environmental and economic costs of dams and destructive river development in general and the Sg. Selangor dam in particular. It started since year 2000 as a volunteer group to protest against the Sg. Selangor Dam and currently active in monitoring and disseminating information on river development and water related projects.
Questions we raised to the National Economic Action Council (NEAC)
We were at Putrajaya to pose the following questions to the NEAC on behalf of many concerned Malaysians regarding the Sungai Selangor dam project of which there has been little transparency and accountability:
1. Why has the NEAC chosen to meet SOS Selangor only after the concession agreement has been signed and work has started?
We question the sincerity of the NEAC in wanting to incorporate our views in solving the water crisis in Selangor when they have arranged this dialogue after the concession agreement for the dam has been signed and work on the dam has started in earnest.
2. How has Selangor water consumers’ interests been safeguarded in the signing of the concession agreement?
Currently, Jabatan Bekalan Air Selangor is distributing treated water at an average price of 86 sen per cubic meter to household and industrial users. With the inflated cost of the whole project, the Splash consortium will be supplying treated water at the rate of at least RM1.30 sen per cubic metre. This is 51% higher than the current price to consumers. (The Sun, 22.11.99) How is this justifiable? The hugely inflated cost of the project must be justified to consumers.
3. Why was the project awarded without an open tender?
We know that there was at least one other contractor that put forward an alternative and lower tender and which did not involve the displacement of the Orang Asli at Pertak and Gerachi. Another bid involved a company which did not need to build any treatment plant, which would have saved consumers considerably. We would like to remind Gamuda shareholders that the Minister for Works, Datuk Seri Samy Vellu has recently pronounced that all projects should be openly tendered so that consumers will gain from the best and lowest-cost tender.
4. Conflict of interest is costly for consumers
There is a clear conflict of interest in this project where a Selangor State Government company, viz. KDEB is directly involved in the Splash consortium which has been awarded the project without an open tender. Consequently, there is no independent judgement when the EIA for the project is conducted by a company appointed by the Splash consortium itself, viz. SMHB Sdn Bhd. Allegations of unethical practice against SMHB Sdn Bhd has been made by one other contract contender, Klang Valley Utilities (KVU) Sdn Bhd:
“From KVU’s findings, it is evident that SMHB’s Table 3 in the EIA report (comparing the Sg. Selangor Dam and alternative dams) can be construed as a deliberate act to discredit KVU’s proposal by the use of unsubstantiated and uncorroborated information, not to mention untruths. This practice is totally against the norms of an independent professional practice of a consultant and must therefore be dismissed as repugnant and ill-willed, whatever the motives.” (KVU’s Response to the Sg.Selangor Dam EIA)
5. The cost of the treatment plants for the project has been grossly inflated
We have been told that the cost of the treatment plant in the SSP3 project is nearly RM1 billion. Now we know that the technology involved in water treatment plants is far from “Star Wars” technology unless the SSP3 treatment plant is going to be lined with Italian marble! The JKR estimate for like treatment plants is only RM200 million.
6. How will the consortium finance the SSP3 project?
Too many infrastructure projects have been awarded to companies which have not convinced shareholders and the public that they are capable of raising the money to start their projects. The Bakun dam was just one example – in the end, taxpayers had to compensate Ekran to the tune of almost RM1 billion and after the area had been thoroughly logged. Ekran’s attempt at raising funds in the market was a flop. So how will the financing for this project be solved? Will the Government or EPF be providing a soft loan or is there going to be foreign assistance? Or will the consortium simply sub-contract the project to some foreign company and earn a commission? Consumers have a right to know because it will be costly for them.
7. Questions over the safety of the proposed dam project:
(i) Half the impounding area is on meta-sediments (soft, porous rocks) presenting high structural risk. The cost of treating this area will again raise the cost of the project. The Federal Department of Geology has said that it is preferable for the dam to be built on solid granite.
(ii) We have good reasons to believe that the consortium has done insufficient bore hole tests at the site especially on the impounding area. We also want to know whether the results of the tests done so far have been verified by the Federal Department of Geology or some other independent body. We maintain that the State Department of Geology cannot be seen to be independent while the State Government has direct interests in the project. The Federal Department of Geology must intervene to assure the public that the bore hole tests have been satisfactorily carried out and that the results of the tests are positive for the dam. We also want to know if the Federal DOE has been involved in discussions over the safety of the dam.
(iii) Why have the 45 conditions attached to the EIA not been released to the public? The safety of the dam and the protection of the environment relies on strict adherence to these conditions. Consumers have a responsibility to demand that these conditions be transparent.
(iv) Where is the Emergency Response Plan in the event of a dam failure? This is only mentioned in passing among the EIA conditions attached to the dam.
8. A conspiracy to suppress information on the availability of groundwater
We believe there is a conspiracy to suppress information based on feasibility studies done by the geology department in the primary industries ministry which show that there is ample groundwater which, together with other sustainable means can dispense with the need to build the Selangor dam. In contrast to the charges of at least RM1.30 per cubic metre by Splash on water from the Sungai Selangor dam, the charges for groundwater will only be around 50 sen per cubic metre.
9. Will the Orang Asli be faced with empty promises and damned lives yet again?
The above are by no means the only questions which concern SOS Selangor. We are concerned about the Malaysian environment, sustainable development and the heritage of the Orang Asli who have lived along Sungai Selangor for generations. The lessons of Batang Ai and Bakun have shown that what awaits displaced indigenous peoples in all the cases of displacement for dam projects is ETHNOCIDE. The compensation package for the Temuans of Peretak and Gerachi is based on the assumption that the Orang Asli do not own the land they currently reside and work on. It only takes into account replacement costs of houses and crops to be inundated but not the rest of their lands. The proposed resettlement package threatens to appropriate more than 80 per cent of their traditional lands (as recognised by the government in 1965), while promising land titles for less than 20 per cent in exchange.
10. The Sg. Selangor Dam will not solve the water crisis
The Sg. Selangor dam cannot solve the water crisis in the country while there is no serious effort to implement a National Water Policy, incorporating water conservation campaigns; water demand management through pricing and fiscal measures; re-piping the water network; cleaning up all rivers and preserving our natural water catchments. Yes, there are more responsible and rational ways to solve the water crisis in the Klang Valley!
In the short-term, efforts can be made to:
– Reduce the consumption of Non-Revenue Water, of which 40% of the total treated water supply is lost through bad management, leakage, industrial consumption, etc.
– Reduce demand by a pricing system that penalises wastage of water and gives incentives to those who save water – industries which use a lot of water must pay more for the privilege without passing the cost to consumers.
– There is ample groundwater which has not been properly looked into and rainwater to be harvested.
– SOS Selangor has also submitted an alternative to pipe water from existing lakes and reservoirs, such as Sg. Perak and the Kenyir Lake to the Klang Valley.
– Set up a Utilities Commission to regulate water tariffs so that consumers will not be at the mercy of the private consortium monopoly.
We therefore call on the Federal Government to intervene and stop the Sg. Selangor dam while these questions of concern to water consumers in Selangor have still not been clarified, and to save the priceless natural and cultural heritage for our future generations that will be destroyed by the dam.

The Rotary Club of Kuala Lumpur (as it was known then), the oldest in South-East Asia, existed in spirit as early as 1918, when leaders of government, commerce and professions residing in Kuala Lumpur mooted the idea of forming an association to promote community service and inter-community harmony.
This lofty idea gained tremendous support from leaders of the various communities in Kuala Lumpur and the Concord Club, organised on Rotary lines, was formed in the early 1920s..
Through the visit of Mr James W Davidson, Rotary International’s “Special Commissioner”, the Concord Club evolved into the Provisional Rotary Club of Kuala Lumpur on 20 July 1928.
The Rotary Club of Kuala Lumpur was inaugurated on 27 September 1929, with Andrew Caldecott (later Sir Andrew)(left) as the Founder President, David Gammans (later Sir David) (right) as the first Secretary and 29 other Founder Members – among whom were famous names such as Raja Tun Uda, Choo Kia Peng (the first Vice President), Loke Choe Thye, Mungo Park, A. Viswalingam, Dato Hamsah B Abdullah, Pat Benjamin Tallala, Khoo Teik Ee, Robert Boyd and A.S. Bailey.
Through an unfortunate administrative mix-up, the Rotary Club of Kuala Lumpur was formally chartered rather belatedly on 15 January 1930, vide Charter No 3268. By the time the Charter was received membership of the Club had increased to 65 and among them was Tan Sri Dato Gunn Lay Teik who later become District Governor.
The Club did not function during the Japanese Occupation, 1942-1946. The first post-war meeting was convened in October 1946, with 3 members. This membership grew to 65 by 1947.
The Rotary Club of Kuala Lumpur has had the honour of sponsoring several Rotary, Rotaract and Interact Clubs. The nine Rotary Clubs it sponsored were Klang Coast (now Klang, 1930), Kuantan (1952/3), Petaling Jaya (1960/61), Pudu (1963/64), Cameron Highlands (1968/9), Kuala Lumpur North (now Gombak 1970), Damansara (1980/1), and Kepong Baru (1989). The Bangsar Club was sponsored by the Damansara Rotary Club and its Founder President was one of our Club’s worthy Rotarians, Lal Chand Mahadev.
Three Youthact Clubs were sponsored by the club in recent years and are still active today. They are Youthact Clubs of Sekolah Sri Garden (2001), SMK Taman Desa (2002) and Alice Smith School (2005) (Equine Park).
The Interact Clubs sponsored are St. John’s Institution (1962/3), Maxwell School (1946/5), Bukit Bintang Girl School (1971/2), Convent Bukit Nenas (1972/3), Setapak High School, Air Panas Girls’ School, Methodist High School (Brickfields), Aminuddin Baki School, Convent Jalan Peel, and Sri Garden School.
Three Rotaract Clubs were sponsored, namely Rotaract Club of Kuala Lumpur (1967/8), Rotaract Club of University of Malaya (1971/2) and Rotaract Club of Stamford Secretarial Centre (1977/8), which later became Rotaract Club of Wanita Wilayah. It ceased operations in 1986. Currently only one club is still active, viz. the Rotaract Club of Kuala Lumpur.
Our activities
The history of charity and community projects of RCKL is wide-ranging. Among the major projects carried out during the past 80 years are the establishment of the Sungei Buloh leprosarium, the first Blood Bank, forming of the Malaysian Association for the Prevention of Tuberculosis, the Brickfields House for Problem Boys, Royal Commonwealth Society of Malaya, Medic Alert Foundation, building of the Rotary-Perkim Rehabilitation Centre, establishing a bakery cum training centre for Pusat Serenti Tampin and the Rotary Training Institute for Carers of the Handicapped (RoTICH).
RCKL also initiated the idea of the Outward Bound School, the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. It sponsored the Malaysian Zoological Society and National Zoo, Diabetes Association, donated a Mobile library, a Mobile Eye Clinic, a Mobile Blood Donor’s van, skating rink at Lake Gardens, Pavilions at Taman Titiwangsa. The club contributed to the Selangor & FT Spastic Children’s Association Building and many other projects.
In recognition of the 70 years of service RCKL had given to the community, the then Sultan of Selangor conferred the royal status on the club effective 8 October 1997. This was and still is a great honour to the club as at that time no other Rotary club in the world had been given the “Royal” status. On 21 October 1997, Rotary International approved the name change of RCKL to The Rotary Club of Kuala Lumpur DiRaja.
This milestone in the history of the club was captured by the issuance of a Souvenir Cover by the then Ministry of Energy, Telecommunications & Post on 28 March 1998 and this was subsequently released for sale to the public.
With its long history – and until recently being the biggest club in the district – it comes as no surprise that some 14 District Governors were elected from the Rotary Club of Kuala Lumpur DiRaja. Today, three of them are still active members of the club. They are Dato’ Hj Mustapha Ma (1986-87), Dato’ Beh Lye Huat (1997-98), and Dato’ Jimmy Lim Thaw Chay (2006-07).
The lifeline of the Rotary Club of Kuala Lumpur DiRaja is the Kuala Lumpur Rotary Charity Foundation (KLRCF). Funds received are channelled into KLRCF and this is run by an elected management committee oversee by trustees. Millions of Malaysian Ringgit were donated over the years and the income generated is being used to fund the numerous charity projects undertaken by the club every year.",jeff_keow@yahoo.com,Rotary Club Of Kuala Lumpur DiRaja,http://rotarykldiraja.org,,

Through its activities the Society has built up good Malaysian-German relations.
The Society in its efforts to promote friendship and understanding between locals and Germans in Penang have organised various functions both cultural and social to bring people together and exposing them to both the cultures of Malaysia and Germany. Thus through the years numerous concerts were held bringing well-known German musicians and orchestras to our shores. German cultural festivities were celebrated with members and friends with the hope that Malaysians would understand better the culture of Germany. At the same time Malaysian festivals were also celebrated with local cultural shows to project the diversity of the Malaysian culture to our German members.
The Society is very fortunate to have the unfailing support of the German Embassy and the Goethe-Institute Kuala Lumpur all these years. The Goethe-Institute in particular, has been invaluable in assisting the Society to invite musicians to perform for us in Penang. We must also express our special thanks to the Goethe-Institute in their help with regards to our German language classes plus providing us with German films and German art for members to learn and enjoy German culture.
In more recent years the Society saw it befitting to embark into a new aspect of its activities.

The HKM remains as the premier journalism award until today. The prize money of the award, sponsored by PETRONAS, stands at RM300,000 a year.
While it continues to offer short and practical courses, workshops, seminars to local journalist, MPI is also offering academic programmes to its members.

Every community has many needs, and just as many resources.
The Community Support Network (CSN) was created to forge links within the community, and networking existing NGO’s, business organisations, the authorities, local agencies and individuals, to support the needs of society at the community level through activities that:
Promote a sense of common identity;
Initiate active community participation;
Integrate and bring together the different generations and groups;
Harness existing resources to build a self-reliant community.
 Registered with the Registrar of Societies on 9 September 1999, CSN is a non-profit; non-religious; non-political organisation with an elected committee and operates with the support and generosity of the public. 
 CSN organises its activities through 4 networking groups, which are chaired by appointed committee members:

Positive Lives Network – Mr. Chris Ng
Positive Therapy Network – Datin Elsie Das
Child Action Network – Mrs. Wong Poei Hong
Some past projects
CSN focuses on the spirit of “Working Together” and supports inter-generational activities.
A World Fit For Children, a national NGO forum & workshop
With support from The Ministry of National Unity and Social Development, Malaysian Child Resource Institute, Malaysian Council for Child Welfare and UNICEF, CSN has been the main organizer of this forum and workshop which brings together child-based social organisations onto a common platform to discus, share and make resolutions towards the advancement of children welfare and rights.
Kampung Care
CSN main aim is to create a common platform for many organisations to share resources in the spirit of “Working Together” to help communities.
CSN began its Kampung Care program with a distressed community in Taman Lindungan Jaya in Petaling Jaya, Selangor in 2000. With the support from the Petaling Jaya City Council, CSN was able to organise its community leaders to work together in the spirit of care and respect by enlisting the resources from 12 different organisations to help bring the community together successfully through economic, health and inter-generational activities.
Child Sexual Abuse Awareness Week
CSN has served as a community platform for child-based organisations to promote the prevention of child sexual abuse.
Current on-going projects
Petaling Jaya Child Council (Since 2009)
CSN is a member of the Petaling Jaya Committee on the city’s “Child Friendly City Initiative”. As the lead NGO, CSN works with the Petaling Jaya City Council’s LA21 Office to implement action plans to help develop the city of Petaling Jaya into a Child Friendly City. It began with the promotion of Child Participation Rights in PJ. This resulted in the formation of the Petaling Jaya Child Council (PJCC) and the creation of a Child Resource Center at the Petaling Jaya Community Library.
In January 2011, 24 children age 14 to 17 years were officially appoint by the Mayor of Petaling Jaya to represent the children of Petaling Jaya. CSN enlisted the expert resources of Childline Malaysia and Persatuan Kebajikan Generasi Gemilang to help in the on-going development activities of the PJCC and the PJ Child Resource Center. UNICEF has been a strong supporter of this initiative.
Selangor Cheshire Home Economic Empowerment Program (Since 2010)
CSN was invited by the Selangor Cheshire Home to help in enhancing its Economic Empowerment Program for youths with learning disabilities.
CSN has successfully initiated a 3-year partnership MOU between the Malaysian Association of Hotels and the Selangor Cheshire Home. This partnership makes available the resources of the Malaysian Hotel Association Education and Training Center to support the program. It has produced more than 100 youths with learning disabilities.

The Malaysian Bar is a creature of statute established under the Advocates and Solicitors’ Ordinance 1947 which ordinance was subsequently repealed by the Legal Profession Act 1976. It is an independent Bar whose aim is to uphold the rule of law and the cause of justice and protect the interest of the legal profession as well as that of the public.
The legal profession in Malaysia is a fused one with a membership of approximately 12,000 members and its membership is increasing by 10 -15% annually. Each advocate and solicitor is automatically a member of the Malaysian Bar so long as he/she holds a valid Practising Certificate.
Who makes up the Bar Council
The Bar Council comprises thirty six (36) members who are elected annually to manage the affairs and execute the functions of the Malaysian Bar. The Council consists of the President, the Vice-President, the immediate past President, the Chairman of each of the Eleven (11) State Bar Committees, one (1) member elected by each of the eleven (11) State Bars to be its representative to the Bar Council and twelve (12) members elected from throughout Peninsular Malaysia by way of postal ballot.
The Office Bearers, namely President, Vice-President, Secretary and Treasurer are elected annually by the Bar Council at its first meeting which is traditionally held immediately after the Annual General Meeting (AGM) of the Malaysian Bar. They are full time practitioners and their honorary appointments are subject to re-election every year. In any event save for the post of the Treasurer which is not provided for in the Act, the Office Bearers cannot hold office for more than two (2) consecutive years.
The Bar Council takes office at the conclusion of the Annual General Meeting and concludes at the AGM of the following year. The members serve on a part-time voluntary basis as the Legal Profession Act prohibits payment of fees or remuneration.
To ensure the effective and efficient management of the affairs of the Malaysian Bar, the Bar Council from time to time delegates its power and functions to Committees in the various States throughout Malaysia or to Committees appointed within the Council itself. The State Bar Committees and Committees of the Council are however not independent and have no power under the Act to air any views on behalf of the Bar.
Purpose of the Malaysian Bar
The purpose of the Malaysian Bar shall be –
(a) to uphold the cause of justice without regard to its own interests or that of its members, uninfluenced by fear or favour;
(b) to maintain and improve the standards of conduct and learning of the legal profession in Malaysia;
(c) to facilitate the acquisition of legal knowledge by members of the legal profession and others;
(d) where requested so to do, to express its view on matters affecting legislation and the administration and practice of the law in Malaysia;
(e) to represent, protect and assist members or of the legal profession in Malaysia and to promote in any proper manner the interests of the legal profession in Malaysia;
(f) to establish libraries and to acquire or rent premises to house the libraries and offices of the Malaysian Bar or amenities for the use of members either alone or in conjunction with any other body or society;
(g) to protect and assist the public in all matters touching ancillary or incidental to the law;
(h) to make provision for or assist in the promotion of a scheme whereby impecunious persons may be represented by advocates and solicitors;
(i) to award prizes and scholarships and to establish and subsidise lectureship in educational institutions in subjects of study relating to law;
(j) to grant pecuniary or other assistance to any association, institute, board or society in Malaysia in the interest of the legal profession or of the law students;
(k) to afford pecuniary and other assistance to members or former members of the Malaysian Bar and to the wives, widows, children and other dependants, whether of members, former members or deceased members who are in need of any such assistance;
(l) to promote good relations and social intercourse amongst members and between members and other persons concerned in the administration of law and justice in Malaysia;
(m) to encourage, establish and maintain good relations with professional bodies of the legal profession in other countries and to participate in the activities of any local or international association and become a member thereof; and

These comprise ordinary people with their own hopes, dreams, aspirations and desires. But poverty, illness, lack of opportunities and other factors have contributed to their disadvantaged and marginalised status.
There is a human face behind those who are labelled poor and deprived. The focus of YSS is to uplift these persons and communities through programmes and services which are direct, practical and which serve both the short and long term. Immediate and direct assistance and intervention are warranted when the situation is desperate and danger looms. Longer term measures are implemented when the situation demands slower change and transformation.
The end goals are the same – to transform the poor and needy into people who are self-reliant, independent and empowered to uplift themselves. The approach is not through charity and handouts but via partnership and cooperation. The long-term strategy is to empower and equip the poor and needy so that they will be able to help themselves and empower others in future.
YSS employs an integrated and wholistic approach because it recognises the inter-connectedness and inter-dependence of the various facets of life. The economic, social, political and emotional aspects of life influence one another.
The services and programmes of YSS complement the research and surveys it carries out. The careful analysis of poverty and human needs will mean more effective intervention and programmes. YSS offers a wide range of services to those who need them – serving small self-help groups to large student groups, and arranging small business loans to disaster relief. In addition, it organises classes and courses in information technology, counselling, self-development, family development and literacy.

UNDP’s technical assistance programmes date from the country’s independence in 1957. In the early years, assistance focused largely on capacity building in technical education and training, as well as health and nutrition. Consistent with this, UNDP supported projects that expanded the physical and social infrastructure, modernised and diversified the agricultural sector, increased manufacturing activities and promoted foreign investments. Up until 1972, UNDP’s involvement was on a project-to-project basis, responsive to sectors and areas of priority as determined by the Government.
Since then, UNDP’s matching development assistance has been in stride with Malaysia’s own five-year national development plans. Over the next three decades, assistance was aimed at expanding and deepening the industrial base and promoting industrial dispersal to less developed states. Apart from helping to formulate the Industrial Master Plan, UNDP assisted in establishing the first technology park in the country. This was to develop vocational education to support growing industry needs.
As manufacturing activities expanded, UNDP assisted in programmes to develop new technologies and the commercialisation of Research and Development (R & D). In other areas, access to clean water supply and health services in rural areas improved significantly. Improvements in the educational system and greater access to education saw advances in educational and literacy levels with more students schooled in the Sciences. New training and vocational institutes also increased the country’s skilled manpower resources to support the continued growth of the economy. As the economy developed and pressures on the environment became evident, UNDP cooperated with the public and private sectors to develop a comprehensive and holistic approach to environmental management and the development of environmentally sound technologies to support the economy.
Through this partnership and the successful implementation of hundreds of projects, UNDP has helped to strengthen the technical capacity of key national institutions, provided critical policy inputs, piloted innovative development projects, and contributed to significant progress in promoting human development in Malaysia. In 2006, Malaysia joined the ranks of countries in the high human development category, according to UNDP’s Human Development Report.",registry.my@undp.org,United Nations Development Programme Malaysia,http://www.undp.org.my,,

The Act was gazetted on 9 September 1999. The inaugural meeting of SUHAKAM was held on 24 April 2000.
The initiative to set up a national human rights institution in Malaysia began with Malaysia’s active participation in the United Nations Commission on Human Rights (UNCHR) in 1993-95 when it was elected as a member of the Commission by the United Nations Economic and Social Council. Malaysia was honoured in 1995 with the election of the leader of the delegation, Tan Sri Dato’ Musa bin Hitam, as the Chairman of the 52nd session of the UNCHR. Malaysia was elected to serve a second term in the UNCHR from 1996-98 and its third term from 2001-2003.
The impetus for the Malaysian Government to finally consider the setting up of a national human rights institution came from several sources. Malaysia’s active involvement in the UNCHR was one. The international attention on human rights as a result of the success of the 1993 World Conference on Human Rights in Vienna where governments, including Malaysia, agreed that human rights are universal and indivisible, and they recognized the importance of setting up national human rights institutions, also influenced the Government.
As leader of the Malaysian delegation to the UNCHR, Tan Sri Musa, in 1994 first suggested to the Government that the time was right for Malaysia to establish its own independent national human rights institution. Several factors influenced this proposal: the growing international emphasis on human rights and recognition that it crosses boundaries and sovereignty; Malaysia’s active involvement in the United Nations system; the changing political climate in Malaysia with a more politically conscious electorate and dynamic civil society. By the mid-1990s, seven Asian countries, including two from ASEAN – Indonesia and the Philippines – had already established national human rights institutions, while Thailand was in the midst of setting up its own.
On 24 April 1999, five years after the idea was first mooted, the Foreign Minister, Datuk Seri Syed Hamid Albar, announced that the Government would table a Bill in the July 1999 sitting of
Parliament to establish the Human Rights Commission of Malaysia. The Bill was guided by the Paris Principles of 1992 which provided the international criteria by which an independent human rights commission should be established, and also by the experience of established human rights institutions, especially in the Asia-Pacific region.
On 3 April 2000, the Government announced the appointment of SUHAKAM’s first Chairman, Tan Sri Dato’ Musa bin Hitam, and the 12 other members of the Commission to serve a two-year term, which is renewable. The appointments were made by His Majesty the Yang DiPertuan Agong on the recommendation of the Prime Minister. Although the Human Rights Commission of Malaysia Act allows for the appointment of up to 20 members, it was decided that SUHAKAM would begin its task with 13 members until such time when more are needed. SUHAKAM members were selected to reflect the diversity and pluralism of Malaysian society and also on the basis of the experience, commitment, independence and integrity of the individual.
In order to carry out its duties and functions more effectively, specific working groups were formed on education and promotions, law reform, treaties and international instruments, economic, social and cultural rights, and complaints and inquiries.
The SUHAKAM secretariat began operating from a container cabin at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Wisma Putra). This was due to space constraints at the Ministry. The Commission finally rented its own premises on the 29th and 30th floors of Menara Tun Razak at Jalan Raja Laut, Kuala Lumpur and moved in on 24 November 2000. The building was chosen in particular for its central location and easy access to the public.

The idea of promoting Taiping as a centre for peace was not arbitrary. Historically, Taiping has been associated with peace since its very inception. In fact, the word ·Taiping· comes form the Chinese phrase for ·Everlasting Peace.· In the mid-19th century, it was discovered that the area was rich in tin deposits. Chinese miners were brought in to mine the ore. In time, two rival clans emerged, the Hai San and the Ghee Hin who competed for water resources, which became known as the Larut wars. This disruption of harmony forced local leaders to seek help of the British to quell the fighting. This invitation led to the signing of the Pangkor Treaty on 20th January 1874, signalling the start of British Administration in Malaya and later, the formation of two towns, Taiping and Kamunting. Thus, the town of Taiping was formed in the very name of peace.
Who are we
To achieve its objectives of promoting Taiping as a peace centre, the Taiping Tourist Association required partners capable of contributing specific expertise, experience and support. After careful consideration, it was decided that the Taiping Municipal Council, the United Nations and Universiti Sains Malaysia would provide the best foundation for its success. Thus formed a unique cooperation between a local community association, the municipal council, an institution of higher learning as well as a global peace organisation.
Definition of Peace
The Taiping Peace Initiative is based on three broad definitions of peace to ensure its activities remain relevant to a widest possible range of groups and individuals, both local and international.
The definitions are:
Taiping is in advantageous position of having all the necessary factors to “live” these definitions of peace in daily life. There are Mosques, Churches, Buddhist and Hindu Temples for residents to find inner peace as well as being a multicultural society where one has ample opportunity to live peacefully in a culturally diverse community. It also has well-maintained gardens within the town and lush jungles on the slopes of Bukit Larut where people can appreciate a peaceful coexistence with nature.
Our partners
 The Taiping Tourist Association (TTA)
The TTA was formed in 1985 by locals keen to put Taiping on the tourist map. It is a membership-based organisation, run by elected members on a voluntary, non-profit basis. The main role of the TTA is to promote tourism in the area, with its recent project being a one-stop tourist center in the heart of Taiping town, known as the ·Taiping Visitor and Information Center·.
As the whole concept was co-conceived by En Anuar Isa, chairman of the Taiping Visitor and Information Centre, coupled with the strategic position of the TTA as a community organisation, it was decided that the TTA should act as the coordinating body and secretariat of the Initiative. Other key individuals are Mr. Beh Yang Toh, former president of the TTA and Mr. D.M. Ponnusamy, former TTA Secretary. Mr. Beh holds many positions in local community groups and is widely respected for his efforts to promote Taiping, while Mr. Ponnusamy is the local historian with several publications to his name.
The TTA has two main strengths. It has a deep understanding of local issues including the type of activities that the locals would support. Because the TTA comprises of residents or former residents, it is also further evidence that this is a local community commitment and not externally based project.
United Nations (UN)
The UN system was invited to become a partner because of its immense experience in peace activities. UN involvement is not restricted to one agency such as UNESCO or UNICEF, or even individual programmes such as the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) but the system as a whole. This allows the expertise and experience of each agency and programme to be made available. However, as one of the founders and Chairperson of this Initiative is Dato· (Dr.) Anwar Fazal, formerly of UNDP, it is likely that this particularly programme would be the main contact.
It is also envisioned that UNESCO should also play a greater role given that peace activities lay directly within its mandate. In fact, United Nations has declared the ·Decade of Peace· and as the Initiative aims to be a long-term commitment, it is relatively important that UNESCO assume a significant role.
The United Nations is also an important partner, as it would weight to the initiative in the eyes of the local population. For the vast majority of local residents, the UN is an organisation they see on television helping people in emergencies or delegates in big meeting halls making important decisions. However, to have the UN in their then would give residents a sense of pride and therefore the added motivation to get involved. UN involvement would also contribute to the often-neglected area of providing school children of small towns with a wider world-view through workshops and perhaps school visits, which would also play a part in their character and career development.
The United Nations has awarded an initial grant of RM15,000 form its Malaysian Representatives Fund to get this Initiative off the ground.
Universiti Sains Malaysia (USM)
USM was chosen as a partner as it had a unit within the School of Social Sciences that is dedicated to peace research. The Research and Education for Peace Unit was established in July 1995 with many of its objectives relevant to the Taiping Peace Initiative. These objectives include carrying out research and education projects on peace and to publish and disseminate research findings for the academic community as well as the general public. Other objectives include the organising of seminars, workshops and provide training for professional peace building skills.
The Research and Education for Peace Unit, on behalf of USM, will provide support on two levels. To ensure that the Initiative’s activities is based on solid academic research as well as to assist in the organising of workshops and other educational programmes that will be an important aspect of the Taiping Peace Initiative.
USM will also provide support in the form of technological advice for the Initiative’s cyber activities such as website design and maintenance. The vice-chancellor of the university, Professor Dato· Dzulkifli Abdul Razak has also pledged support form the other faculties and Schools to ensure the success of the Initiative.
Taiping Municipal Council (MPT)
The Municipal Council will play a crucial role in the success of the Initiative, as many of the activities planned cannot take place without the Council’s approval. However, the Council has shown tremendous support for the Initiative so far under the able leadership of its various presidents. The potential increase in town profile will also benefit the Council through tourism and commerce opportunities. Under the Memorandum of Understanding signed recently, the Council will provide administrative support as well as relevant facilities as required. The Council will soon play a more involved role as the Initiative enters a new phase where it will require a permanent space to serve as the nerve centre for the activities. The President has already articulated the possibility of converting the historic old Town Council building into a PEACE CENTRE. This is an ideal location as it has strong tourism potential and is close proximity to the decision-making bodies of the town.
The Way Forward
The main objectives of the Initiative are 3 :
The initiative hopes to develop these within the Taiping Community and address all three sections of the community.
The Initiative will particularly focus on young people and schools. It will also work at three levels
because peace is a universal idea: peace at home, peace in the community and peace in the world.
The Launch
The launch of the Taiping Peace Initiative and signing of the Memorandum of Understanding between partners took place on the 20th of January 2001 in the Main Function Room of the Municipal Council Building. The signatories were Mdm. Joyce Yu the UNDP Deputy Regional Representative for the UN, Professor Dzulkifli Abdul Razak for Universiti Sains Malaysia, Tuan Haji Anwar Abdul Rahman for the Municipal Council and Mr. Beh Yang Toh for the Taiping Tourism Association.
The date was chosen for its historical significance, as it was the anniversary of the signing of the Pangkor Treaty in 1874 as well as the anniversary of the execution of Maharaja Lela who assassinated Perak British Resident J.W.W. Birch in 1875.
The inaugural meeting of partners preceded the signing of the Memorandum of Understanding. The agenda of the meeting chaired by Dato· (Dr.) Anwar Fazal, included the proposed activities in the coming year and the views, suggestions and concerns of the various partners. In brief, the partners were pleased with the proposed activities although several suggestions were made regarding the timing of events. It was generally agreed that the success of the Initiative depends on the participation of local residents as well as the global link – it was this synergy between local and global (sometimes called “glocal”) and between the spirit of community and global values.",anwarfazal2004@yahoo.com,Taiping Peace Initiative,http://www.everlastingpeace.my,,

1987 saw one of the most widespread crackdowns on social and political activists in living memory – Operasi Lalang. 106 opposition leaders, social activists, religious teachers and educationists were detained without trial under the draconian Internal Security Act (ISA). Many were detained for up to 2 years.When the last of the detainees were released in 1989, the Detainees’ Family Support Group, ISA detainees and other activists formed ‘Suara Rakyat Malaysia’ or SUARAM to campaign for the abolition of the ISA. What started as a single-issue campaign evolved into an activist movement for human rights and democracy in the following years. Presently, SUARAM works towards the realisation of fundamental liberties, democracy and justice in Malaysia.
Is SUARAM partisan?
SUARAM is an independent and a human rights organisation which is not linked to any other agencies. We will always be on the side of victims of human rights violations, the poor and the oppressed, without fear or favour. Our mandate is enshrined in the Malaysian Human Rights Charter and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Thus SUARAM’s main objective is the protection and realisation of human rights in Malaysia regardless of the government-of-the-day.
How is SUARAM funded?
SUARAM is funded by donations and grants from public and private sources. However, the most important source comes from private donations, local fund-raising events, sales of books and campaign merchandise. Funds are accepted strictly on the basis of non-interference of donors.
How does SUARAM operate?
As SUARAM (Suara Inisiatif Sdn Bhd) is registered under the Companies Act of Malaysia, our operations and activities complies with our registration under the law.", suaram@suaram.net,SUARAM,http://www.suaram.net,,

The goal of civil society is to ensure that people are helped to lead better lives.
Yayasan Salam regards volunteer work as a meaningful way to bring about change. Volunteer work helps to build strong communities by cultivating an ethic of sharing, helping and caring. Through Yayasan Salam, Malaysians now have the opportunity to contribute towards the building of civil society when they serve as volunteers at home and overseas.
SALAM volunteers work with people and communities in need, sharing with them their knowledge and skills, and building capabilities. We believe many Malaysians, especially youths, would like to contribute to this effort. Those who become SALAM volunteers will be placed to work with requesting organisations at home and abroad.
The launching of Yayasan Salam is significant in one other respect. For many years Malaysia has been a recipient of aid and assistance from many developed countries. This has contributed in no small measure to our development and progress as a nation. Our success of recent times has given us the confidence and reinforced our commitment to reach out and share our knowledge and expertise with others, within the limits of our resources and capabilities. In this context, the formation of a national volunteer corps and the sending of volunteers across borders is an expression of a new dimension in our nationhood.
Mission Statement
WE, VOLUNTEERS OF SALAM, dedicated to achieving the goals of a civil society where every individual will have the opportunity to lead a life of dignity and fulfilment, hereby pledge:
To uphold and practice the spirit of voluntarism To share knowledge and experience with sincerity and humility To respect the traditions and cultures of other communities To foster friendship and solidarity among all peoples.
The formation of Yayasan Salam underscores our belief that people must make a deliberate effort to reach out to other people to help build a better world.

The Centre for Independent Journalism, Malaysia (CIJ) is a non-profit organisation that aspires for a society that is democratic, just and free where all peoples will enjoy free media and the freedom to express, seek, and impart information.
Background
In response to the 1998 political crisis in Malaysia, a group of five journalists, writers and activists started a project to fill in the demand for critical analysis of the political issues confronting the public. They created a website, saksi.com (“saksi” is Malay for “witness”), which grew to become an important source of analytical and independent information. The strong and positive response to the website prompted the group to register as an organisation to carry out an independent news/content provider project. Thus, the Centre for Independent Journalism was born.
CIJ’s independent radio project RadiQRadio was implemented soon after and had at its peak a staff of 12 who contributed to the fledgling alternative media scene. In early 2003, CIJ explored different ways of broadening the scope of disseminating news across Malaysia. This included collaboration with an Indonesian radio station in Dumai for cross-border transmission. However, technical difficulties and the limited management experience of CIJ in running such a station posed insurmountable, and this particular project was discontinued.
Nevertheless, at the same time CIJ was moving into new, much-needed activities to improve journalism standards and press freedom in Malaysia. The organisation is the leading group in media freedom advocacy and other freedom of expression issues in Malaysia.
Areas of Work
CIJ actively advocates for a broader space for expression and views, and openness of information in Malaysia. We constantly give our perspectives to issues in regards to freedom of expression, media freedom and ethical journalism through press statements, articles, and an annual review on the Malaysian situation. We campaign for the repeal of restrictive laws such as the Printing Presses and Publications Act and the Official Secrets Act and against additional legislative curbs on media freedom. CIJ attempts to raise public awareness on the values of freedom of expression, press freedom and freedom of information by organising and giving talks on these subjects. One of our signature events is the annual celebration of the World Press Freedom Day on May 3. We actively support grassroots media through our citizen radio project and training on podcasts, previously hosted at Radiq.net, to ensure that marginalised community voices are disseminated out there.
We also engage stakeholders, including local and international civil society groups, journalists, academics and lawmakers, to build a strong network for mutual collaboration on free expression. In summary, CIJ strives to fulfill the following objectives:
Promote and defend the exercise of freedom of expression
Ensure good policies and advocating legislative change
Raise public awareness on freedom of expression/information to mobilise support for media freedom, expression and access to information
Facilitating marginalised voices through community media",cijmalaysia@gmail.com,"Centre for Independent Journalism, Malaysia (CIJ)",http://www.facebook.com/CIJ.MY,,

PEMBELA merasakan bahawa kegagalan bertegas dan sikap terlalu melayan tuntutan dan dakwaan sesetengah pihak yang bercanggah dengan kedudukan istimewa agama Islam sebagai agama Persekutuan adalah menjadi antara faktor yang menggalakkan lagi sikap dan tuntutan seumpama itu.
PEMBELA juga amat mengalu-alukan teguran Baginda bahawa falsafah tersirat di sebalik peruntukan-peruntukan Perlembagaan Persekutuan perlu dihormati dan bukan sekadar memperakui apa yang tersirat. Ini adalah kerana, PEMBELA memperhatikan bahawa ada kecenderungan sesetengah pihak untuk akur kepada peruntukan yang tersurat tetapi sering disusuli sikap dan perbuatan yang bercanggah dengan semangat peruntukan perlembagaan yang terbabit. Misalnya, ada yang mengaku akur dengan Perkara 3(1) yang memperuntukkan Islam sebagai agama persekutuan tetapi tidak henti-henti cuba menuntut kedudukan yang sama tinggi bagi agama-agama lain. Sering pula tuntutan ini dibuat dengan cara yang kasar dan dengan pendekatan konfrontasi yang menunjukkan sikap tidak hormat dengan falsafah peruntukan ini.
Oleh itu PEMBELA menyeru semua pihak agar menyambut baik nasihat Sultan ini dan menterjemahkan dalam amalan dan sikap.
PEMBELA juga ingin mengambil kesempatan ini untuk mengajak semua pihak agar mengelakkan sikap ekstrim dalam menangani isu-isu berkaitan agama di negara kita. Ini termasuklah mengelakkan daripada mengeluarkan seruan jihad dan syahid kerana ia boleh disalah-fahami dan menimbulkan tanggapan yang salah terhadap Islam dan penganutnya. Hakikatnya, walaupun ‘jihad’ dan ‘syahid’ adalah prinsip-prinsip yang termaktub dalam agama Islam, prinsip-prinsip ini tertakluk rapi dengan syarat-syarat dan batasan syariat. Ia tidak boleh diisytiharkan dan ditentukan oleh mana-mana individu kecuali pemimpin yang mempunyai kuasa rasmi dalam sesebuah negara Islam.

THE KUALA LUMPUR INITIATIVE TO CRIMINALISE WAR 
17 December 2005
The Kuala Lumpur Global Peace Forum of concerned peoples from all five continents are:
UNITED  in the belief that peace is the essential condition for the survival and well-being of the human race,
DETERMINED  to promote peace and save succeeding generations from the scourge of war,
OUTRAGED  over the frequent resort to war in the settlement of disputes between nations,
DISTURBED  that militarists are preparing for more wars,
TROUBLED  that use of armed force increases insecurity for all, and
TERRIFIED  that the possession of nuclear weapons and the imminent risk of nuclear war will lead to the annihilation of life on earth.
To achieve peace, we now declare that:  Wars increasingly involve the killing of innocent people and are, therefore, abhorrent and criminal. Killings in war are as criminal as the killings within societies in times of peace.
Since killings in peace time are subject to the domestic law of crime, killings in war must likewise be subject to the international law of crimes. This should be so irrespective of whether these killings in war are authorized or permitted by domestic law.  All commercial, financial, industrial and scientific activities that aid and abet war should be criminalised.  All national leaders who initiate aggression must be subjected to the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court.  All nations must strengthen the resolve to accept the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter and institute methods to settle international disputes by peaceful means and to renounce war.  Armed force shall not be used except when authorised by a Resolution passed by two-thirds majority of the total membership of the General Assembly of the United Nations.  All legislators and all members of Government must affirm their belief in peace and pledge to strive for peace. Political parties all over the world must include peace as one of their principal objectives.  Non-Governmental Organisations committed to the promotion of peace should be set up in all nations.  Public servants and professionals, particularly in the medical, legal, educational and scientific fields, must promote peace and campaign actively against war.  The media must actively oppose war and the incitement to war and consciously promote the peaceful settlement of international disputes.  Entertainment media must cease to glorify war and violence and should instead cultivate the ethos of peace. All religious leaders must condemn war and promote peace.  To these ends the Forum resolves to establish a permanent Secretariat in Kuala Lumpur to:
IMPLEMENT this Initiative,
OPPOSE policies and programmes that incite war, and
SEEK the cooperation of NGOs worldwide to achieve the goals of this Initiative.

The MTUC is a federation of trade unions and registered under the Societies Act, 1955. It is the oldest National Centre representing the Malaysian workers. The Unions affiliated to MTUC represent all major industries and sector with approximately 500,000 members.
History

The MTUC came into existence at a time when the First Emergency was declared against insurgent communist activities. At this critical time, workers had no organisation to look after their interest, protect them and also to represent their views generally. A few union leaders who believed in free democratic trade unionism convened a conference of trade union delegates on 27th and 28th February, 1949.
Our functions

a. To do everything to promote the interest of it’s affiliated organisations, to improve the economic and social conditions of workers and render them assistance.
b. To ensure that policies are developed and action taken to ensure full employment, to work towards the establishment of a minimum wage a legal maximum working week of 44 hours and to establish training centres and extension of training facilities for workers.
c. Provision for legislated Social Security measures to provide protection against sickness, unemployment, old age, injury, invalidity and retiring benefits and promotion of high standards of health, hygiene and welfare in all places of employment and seek adequate compensation for workers disabled by accidents and diseases.
Representative of Labour
The MTUC has been recognised by the Government as the representative of workers in Malaysia and is consulted by Government on major changes in labour laws through the National Joint Labour Advisory Council. MTUC also represent labour at the International Labour Organisation Conferences and Meetings.
Our achievement and activities
While MTUC has had many successes on issues favouring workers, there is still a lot to be done. The biggest challenge it now faces is to bring about necessary changes to some of the restrictive provisions in the Trade Union Act, the Industrial Relations Act and the Employment Act.
MTUC is actively involved in helping unions to obtain recognition, mediating in inter-union grievances, assisting unions in their negotiation, mustering support and aid for union projects and programmes, providing advise and assistance in the administrative work of unions, giving help and advice to resolve problems, furnishing important information and data to help unions in collective bargaining, helping to organise workers and helping to increase efficiency, safety and productivity.
Our role in the international arena

Because of MTUC’s international involvement, it is possible to send many union leaders for overseas courses, seminars and conferences. This has gone a long way to strengthen unions and improve international understanding.
A number of international seminars and conferences were hosted by the MTUC successfully. Many of the MTUC leaders are playing an active role internationally. The MTUC President is on the governing board of the ILO. Other leaders also serve in various capacities internationally. The MTUC is held in high esteem because of the progress we have achieved.
Our programmes:
MTUC is pursuing its efforts to establish the following:
a. minimum wage law;
b. five-day work;
c. increase in rate of EPF contribution and SOCSO benefits;
d. amendments to the present labour laws – Employment Act, Trade Union Act and Industrial Relations Act;
e. lifting of restrictions for the formation of bigger unions by workers from related trades;
f. organising the large number of workers yet to be organised including workers in the Free Trade Zone Area;
g. influx of guest workers;
h. retraining for retrenched workers, re-employment of retrenched workers.
The trade union movement in Malaysia has today changed its traditional role of merely promoting bread and butter issues of its members. It is today involving itself in the economic development of the country. MTUC activities are geared to promote equality, improve living standards of workers and create a better and safer working environment.", sgmtuc@gmail.com | mtucgeneral@gmail.com ,Malaysian Trade Union Congress (MTUC),http://www.mtuc.org.my/,,

It is an empire that allows a privileged minority to dominate and control the world. Its dominant power is perpetuated through war and violence.
It is an empire in which the vast majority of humankind remains poor and powerless. It panders to the unbridled greed of a few but fails to provide for the basic needs of the many.
An empire which encourages greed to grow and selfishness to spread is a threat to humanity. It undermines the spiritual and moral basis of civilization.
It would be a tragedy if such an empire becomes the inheritance of our children.
This is why, all of us, wherever we are, and whoever we are, must do all we can to help create a just world. This is the duty and responsibility of every human being. This is a task that transcends ethnic and religious affinities, national and regional boundaries. It is a challenge that goes beyond the North-South divide, the First World-Third World dichotomy.
Today, more than at any other time in the past, human civilization possesses the knowledge and technology to create a just world. We have broken down most of the physical and geographical barriers that separate human beings from one another. Indeed, we have in the last few decades, evolved new and more effective means of communication with the potential of bringing humankind close together. This is what makes the present situation conducive for inter-faith, inter-civilizational dialogue.
Through dialogue and interaction, we shall discover that the spiritual and moral world-views and values embodied in all religious and cultural philosophies can offer the human race much needed guidance in our common quest for a just world.
Contemporary knowledge systems also provide us with fresh insights into the type of structures and relationships that can reduce injustice and enhance justice.
Who we are
The challenge that confronts us now is to harness our values and our knowledge to create a just world. The International Movement for a Just World (JUST) is a response to that challenge. It is because of our commitment to a just world that we decided to establish on the 1st of August 1992 a society which will seek, in a modest way, to develop global awareness of the injustices within the existing system with the aim of evolving an alternative international order which will enhance human dignity and social justice.

It was founded in the state of Perak in 1985 as a research, education and consumer and human rights advocacy group and subsequently expanded into a national organisation, now based in Kuala Lumpur.
ERA Consumer’s early success was getting the national Consumer Protection Act passed. However our evolving work in this area, and our increasing capabilities to train and conduct community trainings, naturally led ERA Consumer to an expanded portfolio of programs. This includes sustained human rights education programs.
ERA Consumer is the only organisation in the country to have translated various United Nations (UN) instruments on human rights into the national language, Bahasa Malaysia or the Malay language. These documents have been disseminated to all the public libraries in the country, the libraries of colleges and universities, foreign diplomatic missions, to a number of foreign NGOs and to the resource centres of local political parties so that they have access to these documents in the language that is most widely used in Malaysia.
In 1999, together with the Canadian Human Rights Foundation, ERA Consumer organised a workshop on a training program for NGOs in supporting the investigative functions of the SUHAKAM. The following year, soon after Parliament passed an Act to establish SUHAKAM, we organised a workshop involving NGO’s on “Understanding the HRC Act”. Subsequently, ERA has held National Consultations annually to assess the performance of SUHAKAM.
For the year 2003, ERA has continued with its efforts to educate the public on human rights. Continuous human rights training programs targeting women and youth have been conducted all over the country. To date ERA have trained 8,000 members of the public on human rights since 1998. Many of whom are members of political parties that we are certain will share the information that been provided to them with the other members of their party. Besides that ERA has also organised further training for participants paying emphasis on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. Training programs are ongoing projects for ERA and it is conducted throughout the year.
Besides education and awareness programs, ERA is also involved in grass root level community projects. We at ERA recognise the need to empower community members of the ethnic minority. We have been selected by the European Union to carry out the setting up of community centres to empower and educate the Indian community in the rural areas. In the course of this project, we have built linkages with community leaders, the grass root community members as well as lesser-known NGO’s.
ERA Consumer is also a member of the Working Group for the ASIAN Human Rights Mechanism. This Working Group is an informal coalition of individuals and groups within the ASIAN region who are working with government institutions and NGOs in the field of human rights. The Working Group’s primary objective is the establishment of an inter-governmental human rights mechanism in South-east Asia.
On an International level, ERA Consumer is a member of Forum Asia. ERA also works with the Canadian Human Rights Foundation and AsiaDHRRA (Development of Human Resources in Rural Areas, a coalition of South and East Asian NGOs working in the area of farmer’s rights), Consumer International, South East Asian Council for Food Security and Fair Trade, on food security and trade issues at a regional level.
In the area of standards, ERA Consumer acts as the consumer watchdog on the government panel working on the adoption of standards set by the International Standards Organisation. On Consumer protection issues, ERA Consumer collaborates with the Federation of Malaysian Consumer Association (FOMCA), the Ministry of Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs and the Regional Office of the United Nations Development Program on environmental issues.

CAP is a grass-roots non-profit, non-governmental organisation registered as a society with the Registrar of Societies, Malaysia since 1970. Through the years, the scope of CAP’s concerns has expanded from matters of daily living such as product price and quality to more complex problems of meeting basic human needs, saving the environment from further deterioration, safeguarding human health, advocating for food security and sustainable livelihoods.
Our activities
CAP has also been actively engaging in human development activities through education, training, capacity building, community based programmes, women’s empowerment, and in advocating a form of development, lifestyle and culture which is ecologically sustainable. As a defender of consumer rights and interests, CAP organises community awareness campaigns on a broad spectrum of consumer, health, social, economy and environment issues that involves research, education, capacity building, organising and media work.
In carrying out its activities, CAP reaches out to a wide range of people in the Malaysian society including rural communities such as farmers, fishermen, plantation workers, squatters, urban consumers, teachers, school children, university students, women youth and religious bodies. CAP publishes an extensive range of educational materials such as the popular bimonthly consumer newspaper “Utusan Konsumer”, pamphlets used in life-skill training courses and books in four languages. Though based in Penang, CAP’s outreach activities cover the whole of Malaysia.
Our vision
Giving a voice to the little people – that is the objective of the Consumers’ Association of Penang. And that’s what we have been doing since our establishment in 1970.
CAP is a consumer organisation with a difference. Fighting for fair prices and good quality products and services is just one of our many activities. Our main concern is ensuring the right of every consumer to basic needs such as food, housing, health care, sanitation facilities, public transport, education and a clean environment. We want to encourage within the people – especially the poor whose needs often go unnoticed – the spirit and the confidence to represent their case to government, to the public and to the private companies that oppress them.
Through research, educational and representational activities, we hope to influence people at all levels: so that policy makers in government look at how their development policies affect ordinary people, and give priority to basic needs; so that ordinary people think more critically and have the strength to resist trends and practices (e.g.: smoking, gambling) that can only make their lives more deprived.
Our mission
To promote and strive for a more ecologically sound and socially just society.

There is nothing like a major disaster to put things into perspective.
If disasters force us to reflect on what’s important, fire makes us think about the importance of what surrounds us. Wind and floods destroy things, sure, but not with the same certainty as fire – fire literally feeds off things, even the air we breathe.
Here is where the Fire Prevention Council Malaysia takes centre-stage.  FIPCOM is a government-linked NGO formed on July 25, 2007 by 23 founding members under the national chairmanship of then-Deputy Minister of Housing & Local Government, Datuk Robert Lau Hoi Chew. The objective of FIPCOM and its role is to complement the functions of the Fire & Rescue Department Malaysia (FRDM) by working together in coordinating and executing fire prevention activities. The Council is open to all government agencies, NGOs, professional bodies, associations, and members of the public. It, in fact, plans to establish a branch in every state.
The council scored another significant milestone when Sarawak became the first state branch and together with the founding member from Sarawak, ASSAR Dagangan, initiate its formation as early as March 2008.
FIPCOM will work together with the Housing and Local Government Ministry, which is studying whether to include voluntary firefighting squads in the Fire Services Act. Amendments to the Act is currently being considered so that these squads, which were currently registered under the Registrar of Societies, could be well assisted and coordinated. This is vital as there are now 315 voluntary firefighting squads nationwide, with a membership of about 13935 volunteers working along with the Fire & Rescue Department.
FIPCOM will strive to make it a priority and counts on the participation and efforts of tens of thousands of fire and safety professionals, emergency volunteers, and other individuals working to reduce the risk of fire and the toll it takes on our society.
As a government-linked NGO, FIPCOM strongly believes that together, we can actively contribute to sharing and collaborating experiences, case studies, resources, learning materials, methods, approaches, evaluations and any other activities or resources related to the development and delivery of safer environments and sustainability education and training towards creating greater awareness on fire prevention.
Our Objectives Presented
Our objectives outline a shared vision for FIPCOM and reflect our core values. They help us set common standards and goals in our aim to provide assistance to any organization and government agency in creating awareness on the dangers of fire and the ways to prevent it. These objectives are listed below:
Our Purposes Defined
There is no doubt that in an industry where change is the norm, setting an agenda to meet all necessary purposes is not easy. We constantly review our objectives against these purposes and against the feedback we get from the public and various entities.

Many of the people in Sandakan carry out normal daily life and lack of knowledge about HIV / AIDS. Women and especially young people are those of high-risk. Financial problems and low economic background matters worse. Immediate action needs to be done to increase knowledge about HIV / AIDS among high-risk patients. Education on the dangers of HIV and “practice safe sex ‘ help reduce the spread of HIV/AIDS. With the hope of our establishment, awareness about HIV / AIDS can be improved.

In 1924, a Dr J Earl Gardner and his wife, Ethel Swing-Gardner first set foot on the Pearl of the Orient with a special mission-to bring western medicine to the Malaya community. They opened their first humble clinic, named “Mission Clinic”, along Muntri Street. Not only was Dr Gardner’s foreign medicine gaining much popularity amongst the local community, but he was also winning the hearts of the people of diverse races and religions because of his sincerity and effective healing methods. It is by no surprise that by 1928, Mission Clinic had gained much recognition amongst the people.
Dr Gardner never discriminated his patients. Whether they were rich, or poor, all were treated alike and it was through his determination to ‘serve all’, his clinic doors were always open to everyone in the community. Dr Gardner’s mission hung proudly in front of the Muntri Clinic, “Poor Treated Free.” The husband and wife team of missionaries believed that everyone deserved a chance at receiving quality healthcare. This mission in reaching out to the poorest of the poor continues today at Penang Adventist Hospital? more than 80 years down the road.
Our vision
We are an enthusiastic group of staff and community partners, working together to build firm relationships with one another and the people whose lives we make a difference in.
We are dedicated towards facilitating the giving of financial and other gifts by philanthropists and channelling the gifts to make a difference in the lives of the poor and needy through medical services of the hospital.
Our journey
At Penang Adventist Hospital, the community and our patients are important to us. As such, we intend to bring our services to all who need quality healthcare. The Medical Social Services Unit was established in 1998 to provide comfort for patients and also financial assistance for those who would otherwise have no means to receive medical treatment.
