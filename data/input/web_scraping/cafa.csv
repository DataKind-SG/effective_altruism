Touching lives of children, mothers and other community members in positive ways is the Ultimate Objective. AAROHAN’s two ways strategyProviding education to children followed by skill training to adolescents and facilitating gainful employment- improving quality of life of the family including education of younger siblings children;Empowering adolescent girls/young mothers through awareness building, functional literacy, skill training facilitating small sustainable business enterprise- improving quality of life of the family including continued education of children.Gender issues and counseling are at the core of all programmatic interventions.Responding to the emerging needs of the community, particularly children and mothers (women)- programs were developed with rights based approach; adding on new verticals in Aarohan’s program portfolio- every program thus having its own genesis.

The only fuel to the motor has been self belief, self sensitization and concern for social and human responsibilities.Aarohan today stands straight having matured and completed a decade since its accidental birth! Noticing a boy, stealing gadgets from her car parked on street moved the Lady, who thought deeper, crystallized the thought process in order to reach at the roots of the problem. It was in Malviya Nagar residential area in South Delhi- declared to be one of the richest consituency in India!Catching the boy in act of stealing, the Lady politely asked him “who he is, what he is doing and why?” The boy mentioned his name as “Rohan” and told he does not get to eat! The lady asked him to come to her home assuring she would offer him food. Then started the dialogue and the boy, given food, agreed to study and leave the habit of sipping intoxicating white fluid (eraser) and stealing! This was the moment when Aarohan got conceived and the newborn started the life journey!Aarohan was thus born out of passion for compassion- a love child born out of heart rather than womb!Aarohan thus is not only a Non-governmental organization (NGO) but much more than that. It is living example of one’s Individual Social Responsibility!Support from CAF America will help a great deal in strengthening Vocational Training Programs for girls/women as part of women’s empowerment initiatives of Aarohan.Aarohan proposes to initiate an extensive focused advocacy addressing the issue of violence against women including the evil practice of female feticide through a team of suitably empowered brigade of adolescent girls/young mothers.",kkverma@aarohanngo.org  ,Education,Aarohan,http://www.aarohanngo.org,"B-127 Malviya Nagar, New Delhi, 110017 INDIA"

The Spastics Society of India began a new model combining education and treatment under one roof. It moved children away from a medical hospital setting to a special school setting to demonstrate that multiply disabled children could be educated and get treatment through a holistic approach. ADAPT has grown to provide inclusive educational, vocational and employment services to more than 3000 children, youth and 10,000 families annually. The services have expanded into the rural areas under the aegis of The Mithu Alur Foundation. Since then it has been serving the country for 40 years in the field of disability. Pedagogy, manpower training was interwoven into the first innovative model. Thus, national level services were pioneered and incubated over forty years with a unique micro, mezzo and macro level approach. All of this has been achieved through rigorous demonstration at the grass roots level across the country on how meaningful; sustainable services can be delivered to the poorest and weakest of our disabled people. Dr Mithu Alur has successfully lobbied for policy reforms and so today the education of CWD has become a constitutional right as mandated in the Right To Education (RTE). Inclusive Education has taken Centre Stage. As a result, children have graduated out of ADAPT into 62 regular partner schools to demonstrate inclusion. Colleges and Universities have also become inclusive and many students have become accountants, computer experts, journalists, librarians and have gone on to pursue Higher Education.  ADAPT is an NGO (non government organisation) which relies on donor support to sustain its services. The services being education and therapy to disabled children of the underprivileged strata of the society and facilitating their inclusion within the mainstream educational system. ADAPT is also imparting skills training to disabled/ underprivileged adults and trying to include them under the mainstream employment. All of these require a huge amount of financial support from the society at large. Grant from CAF America will help ADAPT to reach out to a larger section of the society with multiple disabilities and help them to become dignified and confident and contributing citizens of the country. The grant will also will enable ADAPT to improvise the current and adopt newer initiatives  to reach out to the disadvantaged group of the population in both urban and rural India. ",contact@adaptssi.org  ,Disability,Able Disabled All People Together,http://www.adaptssi.org,"K.C.

UMEED ('hope') provides women in brothel-based prostitution with holistic resources, so they can exit prostitution permanently. UDAAN ('flight') empowers girls (ages 6-18) to pursue high-quality education and mainstream employment away from the red light area, thereby preventing the intergenerational cycle of prostitution. UMANG ('joy') helps toddlers (ages 2-5) develop a wholesome approach in preparation for formal schooling.Founded in 1998, Apne Aap Women’s Collective (AAWC) is an anti-trafficking organization based out of Kamathipura- Asia’s second largest red light district. With an aim to provide aid for women in prostitution, and to prevent inter-generational prostitution, AAWC has developed three projects: Umeed, Udaan and Umang. Umeed is designed specifically to address the issues of health, education, rehabilitation and vocational and life-skill training of the women trafficked into prostitution while Udaan and Umang tackle similar issues but for the adolescent girls and toddlers of Kamathipura, respectively.As of March 2017, we have served approximately 3000 Umeed (direct and indirect) beneficiaries, 632 Udaan beneficiaries and 490 Umang beneficiaries.The objectives of the Umeed Program are to help women who have been trafficked into prostitution with their physical, mental and economic well being. We aim for their holistic development and overall empowerment through services such as finance, empowerment, education, health, recreation and shelter home placement. We also provide our beneficiaries with Adult Literacy Program, vocational training courses, obtaining identity documents (Voter ID, Ration card, etc.) and financial literacy sessions.While serving the women in brothel-based prostitution, AAWC realized that their daughters were at a greater risk of entering the cycle of inter-generational prostitution due to their close proximity to sex trade. We encourage these girls to develop a passion for education, and inculcate a self-confidence in their unique talents. The services provided to the girls include admissions to formal schooling, mentor-mentee programs, after-school tuitions, exposure visits to corporate setups, recreational activities, medical referrals, quarterly medical camps, daily nutritional meals and multivitamin supplements, art and craft activities, therapy, counselling and shelter home services etc.The aims of our Umang Program is to help toddlers develop physically, cognitively, emotionally, and socially in preparation for formal schooling. AAWC started working with the toddlers in the red light community by providing them with a safe and secure environment through various services such as regular kindergarten classes, e-learning, social and life skills sessions, recreational activities, daily nutritional meals and multivitamin supplements, boarding home placement and medical referrals. These services were designed to develop discipline, communication, Neuro-motor coordination, Basic English and Hindi literacy and numeracy etc. Your grant can help women and children of Asia’s second largest red light district get out of the traps of prostitution.On an annual basis, we spend around $6,000 on infrastructure, $3,000 towards nutrition, $1,500 on vocational training and $200 on medical expenses and insurance for all our Umeed beneficiaries.As for our Udaan program, we incur an approximate expenditure of around $17,000 on night-shelter rental, $5,000 on education, $5,000 on nutrition and $3,000 towards extracurricular activities and workshops.On our Umang program, approximately $10,000 is spent on infrastructure while around $3000 is spent on nutrition. $2000 is spent towards dog therapy, while $500 and $700 go towards medical expenses and extra-curricular activities, respectively.According to these approximate expenses, your possible grants can provide a life of dignity and good health to these women and children of Kamathipura and Falkland road.

Observation & Reception Home ChildrenTo rehabilitate the children who are committed crime, abandoned, or abused to rescue and repatriate to the main stream of the Society. Elderly CareTo Avoid the Destitiute Elderly not to wander without the basic needs like food, shelter and Clothing and to provide a dignified life till their end. Tailoring for Women and YouthTo identify the women who are needed to empower to face challenges in life through training and skill development programs. To develop an entrepreneur to self sustain their livelihood. Community Mental HealthTo avoid suicidal death rates and provide awareness, counseling through which individuals are taught to embrace holistic life and offers help line services to the community at large. ARUWE started as a community of those who purposed that they would live to add value to the aspirations and well being of those on the margins of urban development and growth. It started with the vision to do what it takes to transform the lives of the elderly destitute and other needy children and women who were around Ayanavaram. Early responses started as early as 1993. ARUWE, started first as a home for the Destitute Elders has existed for many years .Residential and Day care services are provided for those elderly who were seen helpless and uncared for on the streets. In the year 2000 it entered a new phase of its existence with its registration as a Public Charitable Trust and continues being run by a group of committed Social Work Professionals and a network of committed volunteers who are concerned about the Welfare of the elderly Destitute, deprived Children and Distressed women. Areas of Work:Residential and Day care services for destitute eldersShelter home for the homeless childrenSupplementary education for childrenTailoring institute for womenCommunity programsMental health clinicCounseling services for the distressed. Supportive services for the Destitute Elderly: The core of ARUWE’s work is its engagement with the Destitute Elderly as this was the concern that got ARUWE started. Today ARUWE has both day care as well as residential care services for 30 such persons in need. This number is restricted due to the unavailability of space and infrastructure. ARUWE has had to refer many needy persons who have come seeking support purely because of its insufficient infrastructure. Those elderly in ARUWE access the best of medical care, recreational opportunities, nutrition, income generation options, legal aid and are facilitated towards optimizing on their capabilities towards meaningful living. Supportive services for Urban Community: ARUWE offers various services for the urban poor communities at large in and around the Ayanavaram zone. Local communities are sensitized about their rights and entitlements and various events as well as significant days are used as opportunities to enable local communities with knowledge and understanding on various issues and programmes that will facilitate a greater sense of participation and development. Development Support and Community Care Groups have been formed to facilitate the community move into a more responsible and caring local level response. Awareness programs are conducted according to the needs of the community.  Supportive services for children from marginalized families: Children form another core of the focus of ARUWE. Children living in most of the locations where ARUWE works .They often drop out of schools. ARUWE’s response to this has been to reduce the vulnerability of these children so that they could continue in their education. ARUWE offers supplementary education to these children so that they could be on par with their more fortunate peers. Responding to a need in the community where children were in the habit of skipping their evening meal due to economic compulsions, ARUWE initiated a nutritious meal feeding programme for 50 such children from highly marginalized families.  Education Project:  The main objective of the education project is to identify children below the poverty line from the community and to extend educational support and holistic development, so that such children are assured of safe and secure future. Initially a base line survey was conducted by the volunteers of Aruwe, in order to identify really deserving children who require this support. This project focuses on children who hail from very poor families, while preference been given to children of single women namely widows or deserted by their spouses, besides providing free coaching for all subjects and nutritional care, the volunteers also visit their families and render appropriate counseling and referral services. Through the mentoring system, the social workers from Aruwe closely monitor and guide the progress of each child.  Outcome of the Educational Project: Children who would have lost out on their childhood due to family pressures are, now back in school and are assured of a safe future. Children who have been scholastically backward have shown considerable improvement in their studies due to the personal coaching and mentoring rendered to them at Aruwe. As the focus has been on holistic development through life skills training programmes, the children have developed skills in communication, leadership, and interpersonal relationship. As our children come from very poor families they are deprived of nutritious food. Therefore supplementary nutrition is provided to them by Aruwe as part of the holistic development programme. Shelter for Homeless childrenThere are Homeless families living in New Avadi Road. Most of the children in this community do not go to the schools though some of them are seen to be enrolled in the nearby schools. Thus there is a clear propensity among this community to resort to begging. Along with the children, ARUWE’s work with this community intends to facilitate their access to basic education, primary health and nutrition, and most importantly shelter. Children were in need of care and protection as they are vulnerable to abuse and neglect on the streets. Community Mental Health Project: The Ayanavaram zone has been found to be have an abnormally high Suicide rate that poorly reflects on the mental health status of the urban poor in these areas. It is in this context that ARUWE initiated the Community Mental Health Project. The project supports the community through providing need based Counselling services, promoting an awareness about Mental Health through community interface programmes, enhancing the communities coping skills to stress and enabling pro active measures towards the reduction of life stress. Further persons with Mental Illness as well as Mental Retardation are facilitated with referral services.  Tailoring Institute: As Aruwe is involved in community services and works for the weaker sections of the society. Women who were in need of training were identified and tailoring program was started. This motivated the women and also empowered them to be more self sufficient.

The Street Children Project:A pioneering effort initiated by BECC in the year 1991. Empowerment of Street Children through education and skill training is the ultimate goal of this project. As we see around city of Mumbai, we find many street children in Railway Platforms, Bus Depots, Roadside Pavements, and Road Traffic Signals etc. These children come to Mumbai mostly from broken families, alcoholic, sick, poverty stricken, abusive and violent parents. They long for love, care and support. They are deprived from the basic amenities as they do not have the facilities of adequate shelter, food, clothing, medical care and education. Being ignorant and uneducated, they are forced to take up occupations like rag picking, shoe polishing, low paid casual help at roadside stalls etc. Some are compelled to begging, some fall easy prey to anti-social elements such as drug addiction, pick-pocketing and petty crimes.

We offer a broad array of support ranging from building schools and boarding houses to give students access to quality learning environments, as well as to provide stationery, learning materials and scholarships.Higher Education – to create opportunities for income generation and better quality employment, with a focus on capacity building based on transfer of knowledge and skills. We do this by offering vocational training programmes, employment centers and providing university scholarships to youth. We believe that the key to sustainable development is to carefully listen and understand the true needs of the communities. We use a bottom-up approach that puts the needs of the community at the centre. Once we have established a trusting relationship with a community, we often start our assistance by addressing the needs of the children. We then build on the knowledge gained and the goodwill earned to launch additional community development initiatives. Our funding needs change over time so in order to see the most current needs please visit the following link: http://childsdream.org/donate/funding-needs/ The following are examples of how you can contribute:Building Schools: Depending on the size of the student population and location, the construction of a school building (with between 3 to 6 classrooms) costs US$30,000 to US$60,000 and accommodates around 75 to 200 students. It is also possible to contribute part of the total cost of a school building (e.g. 50%).Boarding Houses: Provide safe and secure living conditions for students to attend school by funding the construction of a boarding house. Depending on the size of the school, a boarding house costs US$20,000 to US$50,000 and accommodates around 20 to 100 students. It is also possible to contribute part of the total cost of a boarding house (e.g. 50%).Children’s Medical Fund: Directly support the needs of a child dealing with significant health issues. Depending on the medical condition, the treatment cost varies from patient to patient. We support approximately 150 children annually with a total budget of US$ 400,000 for an average cost of around $2,700 per child.",marc@childsdream.org  ,"Child and Youth Development, Community Improvement, Education, Healthy Lifestyles",Child's Dream,http://www.childsdream.org,"238/3 Wualai Road, T.

Our scholarships cover all standards from Nur. to 8th class.Gamru Village School exists to support the families in Gamru and the surrounding villages by not only giving the children a good education, but also providing health care and medical attention should it be necessary. In certain cases, when funds permit, we also extend this care to our students’ family members. Older students who leave the school also receive further sponsorship for their continued studies at 9th standard and beyond. Our policy is to never turn away any child in need of help. Most of the children’s parents are unskilled labourers or have a low-income job such as a taxi-driver, peon or porter. It is a struggle for these parents to send them to the free government schools as the cost of books, stationery, the uniform and a daily packed lunch is prohibitively expensive for them. We therefore exist to give every child the same chance at a good start in life. Our PurposeTo provide full scholarships to students, including all school fees, meals, uniforms, books & stationerynecessary from nursery class to 8th standard.To teach the Indian curriculum (in line with the local Himachal Pradesh education authority curriculum and examinations,)in an innovative manner with regular extra-curricular classes; Arts & Crafts, Yoga, Gender education, Environmental studies, Horticulture, Dance and an annual educational day-trip when funds permit.To maximize the participation of girls in education and ensure they receive equal opportunities in all aspects of their lives.To provide a day care centre, so infants have a safe, nurturing environment in which to spend the day. This is very important as children otherwise are usually left at home with their older siblings while their parents work (so their siblings cannot come to school) or they are taken along to the construction sites, which are dangerous.To ensure all children receive at least one healthy, nutritious and filling meal a day. We serve all students rice, dal and vegetables and sometimes fruit as well. They eat as much as they need. Nursery students also receive a healthy breakfast of porridge or banana to supplement their diet and ensure good growth and well-being from an early age.To teach and promote the importance of hygiene awareness and good health. We also provide vitamin supplements for all students, as well as health check-ups and dental checks when possible. There is also a reserve fund for any student should medical care, hospitalisation or surgery be necessary, to help with the financial burden on parents.To establish strong community links within the village and help engender a positive attitude to village life. We promote the importance of respecting the environment and recycling, of abstaining from drinking or drugs, treating both genders as equals and visit homes should there be a need to help families in crisis.	  Gamru Village School is located in Dharamsala, in the Kangra District of Himachal Pradesh state in north-west India. It was founded in 2004 by Phil Adams, a British aid worker who lived in the village at the time. Every day he saw children hanging around the village during the day, often looking after younger siblings. After making some enquiries he soon found out the reason for their non-attendance. They all came from very poor homes. With the help of the local Rotary club, Phil found a vacant building and persuaded parents to let their children attend. Gamru Village School started out with 45 students.  10 years later,  in 2014 there are 175 students in attendance, with 8 full-time teachers and 3 support staff. Gamru Village School is a not-for-profit, charitable society providing quality education and care to under-privileged children who would otherwise face serious barriers to education. The school receives no help from the local education authority or the Indian government and relies entirely on the kindness of a handful of sponsors to keep the school running.In 2008 the school very nearly closed due to a lack of funds.It only takes one sponsor to say that they can no longer commit, or for the current landlord to change his mind for the school to come under serious threat.Any donation received will make an impact: Here are the current costs and how your donation could help: $14          Support 1 student for 1 month (all costs covered)$20          Covers all food costs for one student for 1 year$48          Provides basic first aid supplies and vitamin supplements to all students for 1 year$50          Sponsorship for a student in 9th and 10th standard (covers all government school fees)$50          Buys craft materials for the school for a term$65          Covers all running costs for the entire school for 1 day$130        Covers all stationery and book costs for the entire school for 1 month$150        Covers all costs of supporting 1 student in school for 1 year$180        11th and 12th standard student sponsorship (covers all government school fees)$205        9th and 10th standard sponsorship for gifted students (covers all private school fees)$275        Covers the building rent for 1 month$360        Sponsorship of a student in college for 1 year.

CUPA also partners with policy makers and has taken legal recourse to protect and safeguard the rights of animals, improving welfare standards and their lives in the process.CUPA is a charitable public trust and is recognized as such by both the Central and State governments.  It is committed to providing much needed healthcare and treatment to Bangalore's stray, working and abandoned animals.  Operating from eight centers across the city, CUPA rescues, rehabilitates and re-introduces animals back into their environment or re-homes them through adoption. CUPA's message is spread through its employees and a network of volunteers who (a) conduct adoption drives and make presentations to various public and private agencies and companies; (b) lobby the government for better animal protection laws; (c) educate children through programs in schools and colleges; and (d) provide outreach support to rural and urban handlers of working animals, especially those who live in remote rural areas beyond Bangalore and do not have access to veterinary care and treatment for their animals.   CUPA-sponsored animal welfare inspectors respond to calls made by the public who report the ill-treatment and/or neglect of pet animals by their owners and handlers as well as road accidents involving strays. CUPA has successfully rehabilitated laboratory Beagles three times in recent years – the latest successful rehabilitation of 156 Beagles in May-June 2016 being the largest ever release and re-home operation of laboratory animals undertaken by any individual or organization around the globe – an animal welfare record!  CUPA is at the forefront for initiating action against the institutional and systemic cruelties imposed on animals that are used in the entertainment industry and for religious purposes. This is particularly true for India’s captive elephants who are severely mismanaged in private hands. A multi-prong approach – including advocacy to strengthen laws, awareness through the publication of 50 reports and an operational model rehabilitation centre – have upped the awareness levels with efforts having gained support and momentum. CUPA was founded in 1991 by Crystal Rogers, an English woman, who settled down in India after witnessing the tragic plight of animals in the country.  Since the 1930s, stray dogs in the city as well as urban community dogs (who, unlike strays, have local guardians, but continue to live on the city streets) were executed mercilessly by the local municipality in a desperate, but dismally ineffective, effort to reduce the population of dogs on the streets. CUPA took over the very same municipal facility in 1994 and converted it into an animal birth control center where dogs are neutered and vaccinated by professional veterinarians. Today, this WHO recommended program is recognized and institutionalized nationwide as the effective and humane Animal Birth Control (ABC) program. Over the years, CUPA has opened satellite centers all around the city, each specializing in one or two aspects of animal welfare: sterilization of street dogs, treatment of injured animals, care for abandoned dogs, relief for large animals (like bulls, donkeys, cows, goats, sheep, etc.), natural habitat for wildlife rehabilitation, canine geriatric shelter and a clinic to treat trauma, accident and injury cases 24/7.  CUPA is the only organization in Bangalore to run a round-the-clock emergency hospital for all animals and pets.  A modern, well-equipped, fee-based clinic and grooming facility for pets helps to defray the cost of running the other centers.Given the spread of services provided by CUPA, a grant would inject a much-needed boost to help improve all the facilities noted above.  Additionally, it would help procure another ambulance, which would divide the workload of emergency cases, extend the catchment area and reduce the time for reaching an injured or sick animal.  Funding would also support the need for professional advocacy of welfare concerns that is crucial for bringing greater attention to the undervalued arena of animal welfare.  A grant would help support awareness programs that could lead to localized projects aimed at initiating and nurturing ethical practices among all socioeconomic classes. CUPA is intensely involved in national-level initiatives around the issues of puppy mills, cruel treatment of temple elephants, and stray dogs.  Funding would help to address the root cause of these complex problems through fieldwork and participant-observation, research and case studies, and collaboration with like-minded organizations, all of which are prerequisites for influencing and bringing about change in public policy pertinent to animal welfare in India. Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/cupaindia",suparnaganguly@gmail.com  ,"Animal Welfare, Environment",Compassion Unlimited Plus Action,http://www.cupabangalore.org,"No. 18/1 D-GF, Kensington Apts.

For over 6 decades, DCCW has been aspiring to live up to its mission to “give children a childhood” by helping under-privileged children in and around Delhi who face challenges they cannot overcome.  We achieve this through programs in the areas of health, nutrition, education and rehabilitation of physically and mentally challenged children.  One of our best known programs is PALNA TM, our home for lost and abandoned children, where alongside we run a very successful adoption program. If there is a child who needs help, DCCW is there to assist in every which way it can. Our ProgramsWe strongly believe in providing an environment where all children have the opportunity to realize their potential that is rightfully theirs through our programmes and services, briefly summarised below. All our programs are targeted at children from low income families.PalnaTM: A  home for abandoned and lost children in need of care and protection; in-country and inter-country adoption programmeThe Orthopaedic Centre: Rehabilitation of physically challenged children through surgeries, therapies and providing necessary aidsPalna Shishu Kendra: A new initiative to prepare under privileged children to attend regular school in a safe environmentBal Chetna Outreach: Daycare centre for physically and mentally challenged childrenVocational Training Program: Impart income generating skills to adolescent girls and the physically disabledEducational Sponsorship: Financial assistance for under privileged school going childrenSupervised Homework Scheme: Academic support and homework assistance for under privileged school going childrenWorking Children's Project: Educational support, training in skilled vocations and integration into schools, for working children	  We are extremely proud to see many of our children learning to stand on their own two feet both literally and figuratively, settling down happily in their new families, doing well academically, contributing to their family income and being counted as valued members of society. All this comes at a high cost, and therefore we are requesting your support from CAF America. There are many ways to support our programs, key programs listed belowPALNA Shishu Kendra: These centres are focused on training underprivileged children in the age group 2 – 6 years to attend regular school. They play an important role in the life of an under privileged child whose parents are unable to provide adequate time and resources for the overall development (physical, mental, emotional, social and language development) of their child. Cost per centre Rs. 600,000 (approximately US$ 9500)Day-care centres for mentally challenged children (Balchetna Outreach): Located in the heart of Delhi’s poorest neighbourhoods these centres provide much-needed therapy to special needs children who have almost no other recourse to medical and paramedical facilities. Each centre looks after approximately 25-35 children. These are among Delhi’s most needy children, often neglected by their families who see them as a lifelong burden. Cost per centre Rs 13,00,000 (approximately US$ 21,000).PALNA TM children: Most of these abandoned children arrive at PALNA through the cradle at our gates, and some are brought in by the police. Many come to us in a precarious state of health and need intensive medical care to be healthy. We are proud that the mortality rate at PALNA is now negligible due to the excellent medical and general care provided to the children.

We enable senior citizens to lead active lives through easy access to trusted information, opportunities for productive ageing and social support services. Our GoalsThe goals of the Foundation are threefold.To rid the minds of the senior citizens of the fear that age means decline and retirement means loneliness, isolation, loss of prestige and so on. The Foundation works assiduously to re-instil in the elderly minds the confidence that age and productivity are not mutually exclusive. It does this by utilising their experience and maturity in activities that serve the needs of the community.The other goal is achieved by attending to the needs of the elderly whose social support systems have weakened or are non-existent.Sensitize to society at large and especially the government, police and corporate sector about the challenges and needs of senior citizens.Dignity Foundation runs a number of programs like:Helpline for senior citizens - to address elder abuse and other distress situations. Dignity offers rescue and protection from physical violence from within and outside the family as well as arranging police help. Through trained counselors Dignity provides psychological and emotional support as well as strategies for coping with difficult circumstances.Dementia Day Care Centre - to provide various occupational therapies and tender care to Persons with Dementia and provide relief to their caregivers. Dignity runs the only Dementia Day Care centres in Mumbai and Chennai.Senior Citizens ID Card – Dignity issues Senior Citizen ID Cards on behalf of the Maharashtra Govt. through 150 centres across Maharashtra. Dignity has issued over 1 million such ID Cards. These ID Cards enable senior citizens to avail various governmental benefits.Counselling Services - for various legal, financial and other matters. Dignity has a panel of experts who counsel senior citizens on various issues.Companionship - to mitigate loneliness for senior citizens who cannot step out of their homes. Through a network of trained volunteers, Dignity provides companionship support to senior citizens.Loneliness Mitigation Centres (Chai Masti Centres) - Dignity provides an opportunity to senior citizens to engage in structured activities like yoga, tai chi, bridge, computer classes, etc. and interact with peers on a daily basis. These centres provide a platform for regular social interaction and support network to lonely senior citizens and encourage them to lead an active life. Around 1,000 senior citizens come on a daily basis to our 16 centres – mitigating loneliness and enriching lives.Dignity on Wheels - an outreach programme for reaching out to poor senior citizens. A bus equipped like a mini Foundation with a counselor and an information officer travel to the different wards of Mumbai city every day, especially targeting the poorer localities.Ration Service for poor senior citizens - monthly basket of basic provisions for the very poor senior citizens. Dignity currently supports around 200 beneficiaries on a monthly basis.Dignity Dialogue - Dignity has been publishing a magazine specifically for senior citizens for over 18 years. This monthly magazine provides inspiration, motivation and knowledge to senior citizens and has a large readership. Dignity Foundation is the only comprehensive and long standing NGO dealing with the psychosocial challenges of senior citizens in India.Unprecedented demographic changes are transforming our world. By 2050, 1 of every 5 persons will be aged 60+ as compared to the current 1 of every 10 persons. In India the population of senior citizens is 100 million – which is greater than the population of UK, and will become 324 million by 2050 – greater than the population of USA. These mind boggling figures will have extensive repercussions on all of our lives and not just the policy makers and academia.As a developing country, India has very little social security in place for senior citizens. Pension coverage is as low as 11% of the entire workforce. About 65% of the aged in India depend on others for their day-to-day maintenance. Given the lack of social security, nearly 60% of men and 19% of women aged 60+ have to continue to work to earn a living. Emergence of nuclear families has exposed elders to emotional, physical and financial insecurity. Rising health costs have further strained intergenerational solidarity. Neglect, loneliness, elder abuse and mental health problems of elders are the key challenges of ageing besides financial and health security Dignity Foundation is a not-for-profit organization that has been working for the cause of senior citizens for over 18 years. Dignity helps senior citizens deal with their insecurities and loneliness and brings joy to their lives. Dignity Foundation offers senior citizens an enriching set of opportunities to lead a more dignified, secure, joyful and fulfilling life.

The first is the young person itself who we believe has the potential to overcome adversity and develop the life skills. Next, their closest influencers, after parents, are teachers. And that might include school teachers, caring adults, mentors or facilitators. Beyond the teacher is the volunteer, someone who is a role model and creates positive learning experiences in the young person's life.

While it serves as an umbrella organization for a small number of nominally funded Community Outreach Programs (http://www.hopeforfuture.org.in/community.php), the primary focus of HFFCT organization remains the children. Our Dream To design and create a modern, self-sustaining, family style society in which orphans live in a home setting or with surrogate parents and grandparents in a family setting, receive quality education, learn practical family living and job skills, for future oriented high-tech skills to prepare them to lead satisfying and independent lives. The sad truth about orphanages in India is that most of the children are not orphans. The majority of children arrive on the steps of orphanages through an all-too-common set of tragic circumstances: victims of abject poverty, abuse, total neglect, and complete abandonment. All but one of the orphans at HFFCT falls into this category. We educate, encourage and provide awareness to the parents in an effort to keep their children. If not we are admitting the children into either our child home or to caretakers, we are providing educational support by our school project program. Grace Children's home offers a place of shelter and safety for these ""orphans"". It is a safe place for children.All the children are housed, clothed, fed, educated, and provided with school necessities such as supplies, uniforms, and transport fees. But, most importantly, they are given a family; they become family. Only through the realization of this unconditional acceptance and love are children able to grow in a truly healthy manner. School ProjectWe are very proud of our School Project. We have selected children, especially girl children from nearby villages who were suffering due to the loss of one or both parents with limited outside support in their lives, which usually leave them hungry and homeless and with no hope for an education. If we could not offer assistance to kids living under these conditions, then they would surely disappear into the child labor pool, which is the world of the invisible in India. We see this as an ever-growing need, to step in and help the most unfortunate of the unfortunate. Through School Project a few of the kids have been able to complete their education. But without further assistance, they have no chance to attend any kind of higher studies or vocational training. The need is so great and we hold much hope for this particular project to succeed. But we must seek more sponsors in order to sustain and develop our goals toward helping needy children and women.Hope for Future Charitable Trust (HFFCT) operates solely on donations. We take care of as many children as we can with what donations we receive but, still, we must turn children in need away due to financial constraints. Future PlansTailoring Institute for the poor and widowsVocational training programs for women and youthsExtracurricular youth programs like computer, music, beautician course, etc.Housing and Monthly support for the elderly and widowsDaycare CenterCreate rural development program to assist farmers in need of equipmentRehabilitation programs for the differently ableCommunity program to teach income generation to the poorCommunity awareness program to benefit the tribal people.	 The organization was registered in March 12th 2007 by Rev.J.D.Glaxon, Founder of Hope for Future, as a voluntary, secular and non-profit charity. We are a team of committed people from all walks of life who have dedicated our efforts to the uplifting of the children of the poor and underprivileged.To design and create a modern, self-sustaining, family style society in which orphans/ deserted children live in a home setting or with surrogate parents and grandparents in a family setting. They receive quality education, learn practical family living and job skills, for future oriented high-tech skills to prepare them to lead satisfying and independent lives, education and welfare.Hope for Future Charitable Trust in Chennai serves the needy without caste, creed, color, race, religion or any distinction. The present beneficiaries are orphans, widows, senior citizens, youth and women.The Board of Trustees of the Trust meets annually to plan the financial year goals, budget and implementation process. The board will make available this evaluation report and annual report to the entire general body members at the time of annual general body meeting to ensure the transparency of the organization. The Director Statement I am Glaxon from Kanyakumari District, South India. I was born and brought up from a humble and dedicated Christian family. My father abandonned us when I was only 5 years old, along with my 2 younger brothers. Our life became miserable and sorrowful in this big world without a father. We missed our father's love and affection, which every child desires. My mother even struggled to feed us. During my childhood days, my uncle and grandparents took care of us. However, our other relatives treated us poorly and neglected us because we didn't have our father. My mother was busy with her job as she had a big burden to take care of us and to provide for our needs. Her whole focus was to put all of us in a good position.Due to the heavy burden she was unable to spend her time with us. We had a bad upbringing because we didn't get the love at an early age. When I grew up, I had absolute sympathy and affection towards children. Especially, those who are neglected by their parents and society. I showed them love and care by providing the basic needs which they need in their day-to-day life. I also gave my time to share their sorrows and misery. When I was a young man I saw many parents suffering to provide food, clothes and education to their children. Some of the parents shared their struggles in life to me. My heart was moved when listening to their sorrowful stories. Seeing these situations I made up my mind to start a children home under the kind guidance of God and with the great support of well wishers.The Grant will be applied to:Empower victims of domestic violence and poor and deprived women and children. We will rehabilitate them by providing counselling, vocational training (such as tailoring, beauty courses, computer education and music, etc.) to uplift their standards of living.Educational support by meeting school and university fees for abandonned, poor and needy children.Provide educational tutoring at the evening study center for the village children.Implement health oriented programs to ensure health and safety for the village and needy children's well being.",jdglaxon@gmail.comglaxon@hopeforfuture.org.in ,"Community Improvement, Women and Girls",Hope for Future Charitable Trust,http://www.hopeforfuture.org.in,"No.58,Old T.K.M.Road,Poonjeri,Mamallapuram,Kancheepuram District,South India,Pin:603104., Mamallapuram, 603104 INDIA"

Since our founding in 1992, ICM's community-based, holistic solutions have reached more than 750,000 people living in ultrapoverty, building resilience and greater well-being in families and rural communities via our extensive local network and 10 bases across Central and Southern Philippines.1. ICM is Focused. Our mission is to equip those living at the absolute bottom of the economic ladder to break free from the strongholds keeping them in ultrapoverty. 2. ICM is Effective. We only invest in strategies backed by evidence, not just warm feelings. We vigorously evaluate ourselves through conducting pre and post surveys with our program participants. Transform is ICM’s core program. This 16-week course is designed for adults struggling in ultrapoverty to build capacity in three key areas: Values, Health and Livelihood. After the completion of Transform, ICM's ultrapoor participant experiences:106% increase in household income28% decrease in serious illnesses19% increase in food security3. ICM is Efficient. We are dedicated to delivering the most impact for the lowest cost, capitalizing on local partnerships that allow us to achieve impact at scale. The average cost to deliver Transform to a family of five is only US$70. ICM’s Reach Areas reached by ICM contain over 19 million people, of which 6.5 million live in extreme poverty while 2.2 million live in ultrapoverty. We run over 900 Transform programs, support more than 2,000 medical cases and conduct numerous leadership trainings each year to empower the ultrapoor families to climb out of poverty. Where Will Your Contributions Go? Funds received by ICM through CAFAmerica will go towards subsidizing its flagship Transform program.

The Foundation is dedicated to granting the most cherished wish of children between the ages of 3 and 18 years, living with life-threatening illnesses, irrespective of their socio-economic status, caste, race or religion. It is a registered trust under Bombay Public Trust Act. Each affiliate works within the framework of stringent international policies and guidelines. Ours is the most preferred and highly rated with FOUR STAR rating by International Charity navigator for 9 years in a row and thus we are a global brand and a pioneer in this effort.  The Indian affiliate was established in 1996 and since then we have fulfilled over 25000 wishes across 10 divisions in India. There are 10 divisions of the organization functioning in the country viz. Ahmedabad, Bangalore, Coimbatore, Delhi, Goa, Hyderabad, Jaipur, Kolkata, Mumbai and Pune. Our national office is based in Mumbai. On an average we fulfil about 8 wishes a day within our divisions.About Wish Adoption and Wish Fulfilment The Foundation is dedicated to granting the most cherished wish of children between the ages of 3 and 18 years, living with life-threatening illnesses, irrespective of their socio-economic status, caste, race or religion.The foundation fulfils four types of wishesTravel Wishes: ‘I wish to go…’ (Within India)Occupational Wishes: ‘I wish to be…’ Celebrity Wishes: ‘I wish to meet…’ Gift Wishes: ‘I wish to have…’Power of a Wish: For children battling life-threatening illnesses the joys of childhood are replaced with a daily battle for survival, painful treatment and medication and endless rounds of hospitals. The fulfilment of the most cherished wish of a child who has very little hope of enjoying a normal, healthy life not only gives happiness and joy to him/her but also has a therapeutic effect on the child. Doctors have often reported an improvement in the child’s physical condition, after the fulfilment of his / her dearest wish. A wish fulfilment makes a sick child believe that anything is possible – even the future. Project Relevance and Impact Child health in India is still under critical condition. As per UNICEF – India is among those countries with highest child mortality rate. In 2009 India has a child under 5 year’s mortality rate of 60.6/1000. That means 60.6 out of 1000 children dies before reaching the age of 5 years. Though it is decreasing sharply for last few decades but it still remains one of the highest in the World. However there are various causes for morality amongst children. In our course of work we have realized that there are children suffering from various life-threatening illnesses which put their life in jeopardy. In India, children suffer from various forms of organ Cancer, HIV/AIDS, Thalassemia, Nephrotic Syndrome, Cardiac illness, Haematological illness, Neurological illnesses apart from Mal-nutrition, Diarrhoea, and other infections, all of these are categorized as life threatening illnesses in children. When there is no hope and dejection from constant hospitalization, medication and also awareness that there life span is decreasing, getting their wish fulfilled at times has the most life changing experiences, which we call the ‘Power of a Wish’.  During 2010-2011, Make-A-Wish® America led a study that defined the effects of wishes on the organizations “community” and, for the first time, provided quantitative measures of the breadth and depth of the impact of the organization’s mission activities. The valuable conclusions of the study can be organized into three major areas that the wish process clearly appears to improve: health status, state of mind and community. Project Aim: The goal of the foundation is to fulfil the innermost and cherished wishes of children who are suffering from life threatening medical conditions.

Childcare services intervene in the lives of all three: they enable the young to blossom, the older siblings to go to school and their working mothers to earn a wage - nurturing three generations with one intervention, thus breaking the inter-generational cycle of poverty. Since its inception, Mobile Creches has reached out to 750,000 children, trained 7,000 women as childcare workers, run 700 daycare centres and partnered with 200 builders. What sets Mobile Creches apart, from other children’s organizations, is the context of our work on construction sites and our focus on the ""young child"" under 6 years of age. The early years of a child's life are, normally, a period of rapid growth and maximum learning as well as great vulnerability and dependence on adults. At this time care by a trained, responsible adult - in a clean, secure and stimulating environment - are critical to laying the foundations for health, learning capacities and personality. When this ‘young child’ is also a ""migrant child"" living on a construction site, the odds against survival, protection and development become manifold.Mobile Creches was an idea born out of compassion for children, indignation at their plight and the determination to make change. The first ‘mobile creche’ was set up in 1969, at a construction site near Rajghat, in Delhi. It was a safe, nurturing shelter for the children of construction workers, on the site near the hutments, where the little ones could play, learn, eat and sleep.  And the idea spread: from building sites to urban slums, from Delhi to Mumbai and Pune*; from childcare services to awareness building of communities, training of childcare workers and advocacy with governments for better policies, laws and programmes. The idea started a movement in Early Childhood Care and Development (ECCD), much needed in a country where the young ones suffer the greatest neglect: the mother leaves for work to make ends meet, the little sister is no substitute for a responsible care-giver, and there are no institutional arrangements to take care of the young child. There are 60 million under-6 children living in poverty, and in dire need of care.Every year, Mobile Creches provides education, nutrition and health for 14,000 children, reaches out to 5,500 families, trains 500 community women as childcare workers & NGO friends, and advocates for policy change. You can help Mobile Creches further its mission, and continue to be the voice of the unheard and unseen young child on construction sites and urban slums, in the following ways: $50 will support a street play to raise awareness on health and education$120 will help organize a Health Camp for 100 community members /children$175 will help organize an Art Workshop at a daycare centre for 50 children$300 will take full care of a child for one year (health, nutrition and education), 9 am - 5 pm, 6 days a week at a construction site childcare centre$1500 will take full care of 5 children for one year (health, nutrition and education), 9 am - 5 pm, 6 days a week at a construction site childcare centre$3000 will take full care of 10 children for one year (health, nutrition and education), 9 am - 5 pm, 6 days a week at a construction site childcare centre           The above is to illustrate the change to the lives of children.

The common meeting point was doing some good for the less fortunate. Not one of them had the faintest idea that this small endeavor would synergize into a passion over four and half decades. Three of the founding members are still a part of the present group of twelve Trustees of MESCO (2 of the founders are no more, but served the cause till their end.) MESCO started its service by loaning out text-books to a handful of school and then college students, also assisting people for various basic survival issues. The Organization was registered and started functioning as a proper NGO with three thrust areas namely, Education, Medical Services and Poverty Relief. MESCO is registered under the Indian Societies Registration Act, 1860 and Bombay Public Trusts Act, 1950. Donations made get exemption under 80 G of the Income-Tax Act. The organization has registration under Foreign Contribution Regulation Act (FCRA), 1976, which enables donors to remit their donation in foreign currency. In addition MESCO is accredited by Credibility Alliance, registered with GiveIndia and Tata Institute of Social Sciences as a credible organization to receive donation for the cause of humanity. MESCO has an extensive scholarship programme and provides scholarships to almost 2000 students (1200  school, 900  post school and 60 to students doing  vocational/trade courses) on purely means basis and another 330 gift scholarships to meritorious (school/college) students amongst the means deprived, as also 200 interest-free Loan scholarships to students doing professional courses.One of the prominent achievements from MESCO’s Educational Schemes is the change in the lives of many families from underprivileged section of the society, who approached MESCO for financial assistance to educate their children, and after providing the required support, these children have become medical practitioners, engineers, entrepreneurs and professionals in various fields and most of them are hired by reputed companies and organizations. While some of them have joined our management, many of them have been working to strengthen our mission of changing lives by becoming our regular donors, supporting the families in dire need of assistance to reach a level of self sustenance.Towards its second objective - that of Medical services, MESCO has three Mobile Clinics and 2 Dispensaries which together diagnose and treat almost 80,000 patients per annum in 14 slum areas. We provide medical services such as consulting, diagnosis and medicines at a subsidized rate. The deficit of around Rs.300,000/- per annum is covered through specific donations from donors. In addition it provides financial assistance to poor patients undergoing expensive treatment such as dialysis, heart surgeries etc., for diagnostic procedures besides such as CT scan, MRI etc as also for prosthesis. MESCO spends over Rs. 87 lacs annually for financial assistance provided to more than 400 patients annually.Yet another thrust area for MESCO is Poverty Relief. A dry ration is provided to 300+ families living in abject poverty. In addition MESCO also provides 75 Sewing machines annually (mostly to women living in slums) as a means of earning their livelihood.Both MESCO is supported by voluntary donations from individuals (families), corpus donors as well as from Charities and Foundations from India and abroad. Many of its beneficiaries in different schemes and also nursery schools are sponsored. MESCO receives zakat and also raises funds from sale of old newspapers and old clothes collected from over 3000 households each month. MESCO however runs a hand to mouth existence which can be very stressful. MESCO is currently appealing to prospective donors to donate through its Payroll Giving Scheme on monthly basis. With your support together we can change the lives of many who are in dire need of help, by providing education to the students from the underprivileged section of the society, assisting patients who cannot afford to meet the cost of treatment due to their limited income; and bringing the destitute women to a level of self sufficiency by providing ration support and sewing machines, till their children are grown and earn enough to support the family.",mescotrust@mescotrust.org  ,"Child and Youth Development, Community Improvement",Modern Educational Social & Cultural Organization,http://www.mescotrust.org,"110, Natalwala Building, V.S.

NDS has successfully impacted the lives of over 3500 deaf children and youth and facilitated employment for over 800 youth in some of the most leading companies across sectors ranging from Hospitality, Retail, Information Technology, Banking, Print and Publishing, Education, Textile and Manufacturing among others. Today, NDS has 5 centers in four states of India –Rajasthan, Haryana, Delhi and Uttar Pradesh. Our beneficiaries belong to under-privileged sections of society. Our activities include the following:Creation of specialized curricula: NDS is a pioneer in development of curricula for Desktop Publishing/ Graphic Design, English Communication, Basic IT ,Indian Sign Language, Hospitality and Workplace Readiness for the deaf community in the country.Creating a pool of trainers/special educators/ interpreters for the deaf community: NDS has trained over  50 trainers/special educators and interpreters. NDS trained trainers are also being employed at other organizations to teach deaf children and youth.Remedial Education: This is a specialized remedial program for school going Deaf children. Classes are held post school hours at NDS where the focus is on building communication skills through Indian Sign Language, English and Hindi. Students are also taught Functional Mathematics, General Knowledge and Core Life skills. The core objective is to enable Deaf children to grow into confident adults and equip them with the right foundation to access vocational training at NDS after finishing school. The program reaches out to 100 children every year.Vocational Training:  We use Technology to enable learning  and we follow the bi-lingual method wherein a strong language base is developed (Indian Sign Language) and through which other skills are taught in an interactive and participative environment by deaf trainers. Our trainings are based on intense market research and are job oriented in nature. Employability quotient is enhanced through industry accreditation of IT training programs. Awareness: Towards creating a more sensitized and inclusive society, NDS raises awareness about the abilities of the deaf and sign language at various forums. Through seminars, workshops, presentations, one on one dialogues and social media NDS is engaging with at least 5000 people every year including families, mainstream educational and training institutions, industry and other civil society organizations. Volunteerism: NDS encourages the spirit of giving back to society through a vibrant volunteer program. People from all walks of life and professions are able to bring in their diverse skill sets and build the capacities of our students, team and organization as a whole. NDS has engaged with close to 100 volunteers belonging to diverse backgrounds including students, homemakers, professionals and corporate volunteers.Industry engagement:Collaborative Trainings in partnership with the industry to bridge the needs of the industryStudents are provided regular exposure to the industry for them to understand the operations on the work floor and get hands on experience. Employment:NDS has been successful in transforming the industry perception and carving a niche for deaf youth in the industry. Till a few years back the only option available for deaf youth was menial labor. With customized curricula and market aligned training NDS has been able to provide the right skill sets to its youth and today over 800 youth are working successfully in some of the most leading companies in the country. While the overall employment figures for the disabled in the country are less than 0.05% in the private sector (http://paper.hindustantimes.com/epaper/viewer.aspx),  NDS has an employment rate of close to 30%. NDS was started by Ms. Ruma Roka who until 2005 was a homemaker restless to find a mission and meaning to life and a dream to start a school. She started from a small two bed room flat belonging to her husband in Noida, which is a suburb near New Delhi, India. The journey started with just five students and Ruma as the only trainer. Through word of mouth the organization started growing and is today reaching out to over 1200 students every year. We currently have five training centres- two of which are in Noida (suburb of Delhi), one in an urban slum in New Delhi, one in Hisar, a small town in Haryana and one in Jaipur, Rajasthan. Our students belong to economically weak sections of society and are coming from all across the country even places as far as Bihar, Jharkhand, Kerala and Orissa among others. NDS has successfully impacted the lives of over 3500 deaf children and youth and facilitated employment for over 800 youth in some of the most leading companies across sectors ranging from Hospitality, Retail, Information Technology, Banking, Print and Publishing, Education, Textile and Manufacturing among others. We are a funded organization and receive less than 10% of monies as fees from our beneficiaries who come mostly from economically backward areas of the country. A Grant from CAF America would ensure that we are able to positively impact underprivileged deaf youth with relevant employability skills and help them lead lives of dignity as productive partners in our society through gainful employment.  We continue to develop custom-curriculum, developing future deaf trainers and managing the operations costs of salaries of our trainers. All our trainers are deaf.

The key determinant of the human condition is the 'sense of agency' ( We or I matter). PRADAN's aim, therefore, is to stimulate and enhance the sense of agency of collectives of poor people, especially women, leading to occupy their space as equals in society and taking on responsibilities of citizenship. It is also thereby expected to influence a change in the behavior of various factors that have led to their present situation. Along with enhancing the sense of agency of poor people, a focus on reducing severe deprivation must be a necessary and key element of strategies for poverty eradication. To succeed, such engagement must be rooted in the belief, a priori, that people have capability, that they are worthy and can be the drivers of change. In more operational terms, this means that women from marginalized communities are organized into collectives who by exerting a normative influence on their society, are not only working for increasing the income of poor households but also their overall empowerment. Instead of PRADAN, these communities are the drivers of change. Hence we believe that  collectives and groups need to be the primary focus of a change intervention because they provide the strength to deal with the inequities in society and the wisdom of a group embodies the best ideas if all its members. Sustained change requires a change in shared values, beliefs, norms and behavior in society and a collective is better equipped to do this, it brings and binds people together through an interdependence of destiny as well as an interdependence of task, the task of building a better life for the entire community.To fructify the vision we plant to reach 1.5 million rural poor families  this means 20 percent of poor families in the fifty poorest districts of India by 2022.

Created in 1990 with just one child, Balkutir has grown to become a full family with 47 children of all ages.It provides shelter, food, education and healthcare. While those are necessities, Balkutir also provides something that is far more critical: improvement of a child's self-esteem and outlook towards life.Sai Shiksha Sansthan - Created in 1991, Sal Shiksha Sansthan is a progressive English medium school. It has grown from being a primary school of 80 children into a co-educational secondary school of 370 children.Sai Bal Sansar -Since 1999, children have been provided informal education, free of cost, with the inclusion of a midday meal. Sai Bal Sansar is located in the village of Agahpur, Sector-41 Noida. With the belief that all children are unique, talented and capable of excelling, every teacher is taught to nurture each child's talent so that they may excel.Sai Vatsalya Vatika - Created in 2009, Sai Vatsalya Vatika is a specialized learning environment catered to fit the needs of children with physical and learning disabilities.

It struck a chord in the hearts of compassionate citizens, who identified the mine of potential in India's street children. This small group lost no time to create a space in the form of a Trust where young street boys and girls could feel secure and could breathe hope. Keeping in tandem with the nature of the children, the name 'Salaam Baalak Trust' which literally translates into salute the child seemed befitting. For the past 25 years, Delhi-based Salaam Baalak Trust (SBT) has been dedicated to the care and protection of street children, regardless of caste, color, creed or religion by living or working in and around railway station, at crowded bus stops, slums, congested business and tourist areas. From 3 staff and 25 children on a balcony of Ground Reserve Police at the New Delhi Railway station, SBT has now grown to over 150 staff, providing support services in Delhi & NCR region. SBT currently functions through 17 Contact Points/ Day Care Centers and 5 Shelter Homes, which provide a holistic child development package. SBT also manages 1098- emergency Child helpline is a toll free number to reach out to children in distress at any point of time. This 25 year young organization has already provided support to more than 50,000 children from all over the country and abroad. On an average, SBT's team reaches and protects over 5,000 children annually. While a large chunk of children are re-united successfully with their families, SBT becomes family for young lives who have no one to return to. Though a family can never be replaced, a child friendly environment, access to basic child rights, and mentorship of staff at SBT provides an unique support system for the children. As a result, children from SBT are empowered young citizens with their heart in the right place. Children who have flown from the SBT nest have gone on to establish meaningful lives for themselves. Majority is married, and can afford to send their children to good schools.

Since our inception in 1970, the Foundation has grown into a well-established and reputable organisation with local and international links. Our mission is to promote heart health, prevent and reduce disability & death due to cardiovascular diseases and stroke.SHF fulfils its mission through educational programmes highlighting preventive measures against heart disease to the public. We do so via two major annual awareness campaigns; National Heart Week/World Heart Day and Go Red For Women, to reach out to the community and spread the message of heart health. Activities include healthy cooking demonstrations, health screenings and physical activity performances. We focus on rehabilitative and preventive care for recovering heart patients and at-risk individuals. SHF is the only institution in Singapore that runs a structured community-based Heart Wellness Programme, including Phase 4 Cardiac Rehabilitation. Other services include health talks, nutrition consultations and smoking cessation counselling. In addition, SHF also offers a funding scheme for needy heart patients for three specific areas; Mechanical Heart Device, Emergency Relief Assistance (a monthly sum of money is given to patients who are unable to return to work immediately due to their heart condition or surgical procedure) and Heart Transplant. Our Heart Safe department aims to improve the out-of-hospital sudden cardiac arrest survival rate in Singapore (currently at a dismal 2.7%) by creating an environment for more effective use of CPR and Automated External Defibrillators (AED) in the community. We’ve broken two Guinness World records at our National Life Saving Day events in 2011 & 2012 for the “Largest number of people trained and certified in CPR at a single mass event” and the “Largest AED training session”. SHF strongly believes that educating and empowering the young, is critical in helping to prevent cardiovascular disease. Besides students, we also reach out to school communities which include teachers, staff and parents through the following programmes: Health Mapping Exercise (free basic health screening services to lower income residents living in one and two room rental flats), BP Initiative @ Schools (students are taught on how to monitor their blood pressure levels) and Jump Rope For Heart (a holistic heart health education programme that promotes an active lifestyle through rope skipping lessons and nutrition education).

+91 22 25185821 / 25185823        ,"The vision of Teach for India is that one day, all children will attain an excellent education. This lies in stark contrast to the situation today, wherein few students pass through the system, and most of those that do, receive a highly inadequate education. Because of the size and complexity of the Indian education system, coupled with rapid population growth and urbanization, grassroots interventions along are insufficient to address problems. The core belief at Teach for India is that the root of systemic change is leadership - leadership that understands the problem, knows how to change it, and is committed to doing so. Teach for India's mission is to build a movement of leaders who will end educational inequity. Teach for India recruits India's most outstanding college graduates and young professionals and places them as full time teachers in under-resourced schools for two years. In the short run, these young leaders act as a source of dedicated teachers in government and low-income private schools. In the long run, Teach for India will build a powerful and ever-growing leadership force of alumni who, informed by their experience and insights, will work from inside and outside the educational system to effect the fundamental long-term changes necessary to ultimately realize educational opportunity for all.Teach For India believes that an excellent education is one that combines Academics, Values and Mindsets, Access and Exposure. Additionally, in the second year of Fellowship, Fellows undertake a Be the Change Project (BTCP) project designed to identify and address a barrier to learning which exists in the school or larger community. The Fellowship program is structured around the rigorous curriculum developed by Educational Initiatives, in addition to teaching the SSC curriculum. Most students have skill-levels 2-4 years behind their current grade level and Teach For India aims to bridge that gap primarily in Reading Comprehension, Reading Fluency, Math, Grammar and Writing. Teach for India has a five-part model: Talent Sourcing: Teach For India recruits the highest-quality university graduates and young professionals, who drive student achievement and become life-long leaders able to effect systemic change. For the 2014 Fellowship, Teach For India received 13,500 applications and selected 7% of the applications, those with the most exceptional track records of leadership and demonstrated commitment to the cause.Talent Development: Teach For India then provides participants with rigorous training and professional development. Training begins with an intensive five-week residential course, led by international experts, and continues with weekly trainings and support from mentor teachers, throughout the two years.Talent Placement: Teach For India places participants for two years in full-time teaching positions, with clear accountability for their classrooms, in areas with educational inequality where impact on student achievement will be maximized. An extensive rubric is used to determine which schools are chosen, with emphasis on the need within those schools, and their willingness to partner.Alumni Impact: Teach For India plays an active role in ensuring that the Alumni of the program are excellent ambassadors who have the mind-sets and skills to create exponential and collective impact who will lead the change and fight for education inequity. The Alumni are spread across diverse sectors – becoming teachers, school leaders, policy makers, lawyers, artists, corporate leaders who will work together to make India a nation where all children reach their potential. This includes arranging summer internships between the first and second years of the Fellowship, hosting “pathway calls” through conference calls hosting leaders and alumni in the educational sector for Fellows, mentorship programs for Fellows, and career support, which in 2013-14 featured approximately 141 employers and 296 job postings. Over 60% of alumni have stayed back in the social development sector because of their experience at Teach For India.Measurable Impact: Teach For India works to drive measurable short-term impact on student achievement and foster long-term development of leaders who will help eliminate educational inequality. Teach For India assesses impact on student achievement, the school and community, and on the Fellows themselves.Teach For India, a project of Teach To Lead, began in 2009 with 87 Fellows teaching in 33 under-resourced schools reaching out to more than 2,500 children in Mumbai and Pune. In 2014-15, Teach For India projects its impact to span 6 cities (Mumbai, Pune, Delhi, Chennai, Hyderabad and Ahmedabad), with a cohort strength of 925 Fellows, in 2850 schools impacting 32,0000 students.Your support will ensure that 32,000 children from low-income schools across India will attain excellent education.$30   Ensures 2 children from a under-resourced school get excellent education for 1 month$51 Ensures 4 children from an under-resourced school get excellent education for 1 month$108 Will provide accommodation for 1 Fellow for 1 month$154 Will provide excellent education to 1 child for 1 year$559 Ensures 1 Fellow gets training support and teaching resources for 1 year$1,543 Will provide excellent education for 10 children for 1 year$5,400 Ensures 1 classroom of 35 children gets an excellent education for 1 year",kaveri.gupta@teachforindia.org  ,"Child and Youth Development, Education",Teach to Lead,http://www.teachforindia.org,"Godrej One, Second Floor Pirojshanagar, Eastern Express Highway, Vikhroli East, Mumbai, 400 050 INDIA"

Concerned about the lack of opportunities for underserved communities especially, women and children a few likeminded people came together and registered Udayan Care in 1994 as a Public Charitable Trust. The aim was to bring sunshine into the lives of vulnerable children, women and youth by empowering them. We began with a thorough research on existing models for children in need of care & protection and opportunities that existed for young girls, women and disadvantaged youth. The dynamism of the founders and the strong team work were the key factors in developing Udayan Care’s innovative models across all its programmes – Udayan Ghars in 1996, Udayan Shalini Fellowships in 2002, Udayan Care Information and Technology Vocational Training and Udayan Outreach, in 2004. It is only the steadfast belief of thousands of people across the globe that has enabled us to bring hope and joy in the lives of more than 11,000 children, women and youth. Each milestone in our 19 year journey has been possible only because someone somewhere made a choice to support the rights of the children and youth we serve.The grant will make a difference in the lives of all those young children who are orphaned and abandoned children to find a family and home with much need care, love and protection to call their own so that they grow up to be confident, independent and responsible citizens of tomorrow.
